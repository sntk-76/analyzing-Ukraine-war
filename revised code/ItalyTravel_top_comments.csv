Please come back so we can arrange a robbery as soon as you land"
lfcd1wt,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I go every year, usually twice, popping down from Switzerland so mostly in Northern Italy (Como, Turin, Florence, Venice, Padua, Genoa, Parma, Bologna, Vicenza, Brescia, Bergamo, Stresa etc. but also Puglia, Rome and Naples.

Every time I get amazing food , lovely people and a great time (speaking reasonable Italian does help along with experience to avoid tourist traps), the beauty of the country for a tourist is endless.

The only negatives are the relentlessly obnoxious and aggressive drivers, it always amazes me, so many chilled, friendly people turn into psychos the second they get behind a wheel.

No-one ever just drives, anywhere, you can never just drive at the speed limit, there is always, always some prick driving right up your arse, overtaking like a psycho while gesticulating offensively.

I'm not a slow driver at all but I don't want every second of every trip to be a pedal to the metal race so ultimately driving is not enjoyable and always stressful."
lfc44xn,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,Of course. Italy is a civilized country with friendly people.
lfc60if,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,You have to be a regular on this Reddit to understand this. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
lfc77xs,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Italy is a first world country member of the g7 and global power, here sometimes everyone seem to forget that and describe the country like is some scammer/garbage hell"
lfc5xll,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,Thank you for throwing a bit of positivity with the few bad experiences! I’m sure the vast majority of folks traveling will also have great experiences in Italy!!
lfc93n4,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"lol… thank you for posting this. I traveled to Italy last July without incident and I’m leaving tonight for Milan and Venice. After being on this sub, it had me in a panic that I’d be robbed or have luggage stolen on the trains. I bought a bike lock and spent my evening scouring reviews of my hotels to make sure they are in safe areas. Although I feel for anyone who had their trip disrupted by the incidents posted, I try to remind myself there are just a couple stories out of thousands of travelers in Italy right now."
lfc6kp2,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Good joke. 

People posting this stuff on regular basis  probably do not understand how insulting this may look to locals."
lfc8gju,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Usually we ear the people getting robbed insthead of 10000 that had a good experience. Thats how media works, in any country you live medias will try to make it look like the worst. ""The grass of the neighbor is always greener"""
lfca46z,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"That's intolerable!
Next time you'll be coming here, warn us in advance, please."
lfgmf1e,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Same with my trip this year, my friend and I went to Venice, Bologna, Florence, and Pisa over 10 days in April. We travelled by train between cities which was so easy. Despite being in busy cities and walking a lot, our trip felt super relaxed. It was my second time visiting Italy, and I adore the country. Such a beautiful place with lovely people and amazing food. Ngl, some of the best bits were just sitting in a square with a gelato and watching the people and pigeons in the sun. 

Never once felt any danger walking around day or night.

People just need to be aware of scams they could fall into and keep their bag on their belly in busy places and they'll usually be fine."
lfh6iap,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I am an Italian living abroad. I lived in Italy 21 years and visit multiple times each year. Never got robbed or any bad scam happened to me. 

I think the key is simply to practice basic caution. This is of course not a ‘justification’ for when bad things happen, but it’s general traveling advice. Stuff like check the car actually locked before leaving it, not leaving luggage or valuables unattended, doing some research and not simply hopping in the first restaurant / service provider that happens to be on your way, avoiding shady areas in the evening, be aware of your sorroundings, etc. 

Italy is not unsafe overall but obviously petty crime exists and it exponentially focuses on easy targets. If you adopt precautions I find it difficult you’ll be a victim because, once again, Italy is not for example like some areas in South America where vast part of the population lives off crime and targets foreigners (nothing against South America, many great and safe places there too!).

Unfortunately many tourists, and especially Americans in my opinion, are just too ‘lazy’ to do any research whatsoever or adopt basic precaution. Of course, in an ideal world you should be able to leave your 20k worth of luggage visibile in the car and come back after lunch finding it there. But in reality this is not always the case in reality - really almost nowhere. Once again, using your brain is the best insurance against theft and scams. Sadly lots of people refuse to use their brain, especially when on holiday."
lfcqc9i,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Ok guys, these posts are getting annoying"
lfcytpa,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I'm just now starting to plan our honeymoon in Italy. Since you've been a few times and went north and south, what's your opinion on going to Rome? My husband wanted to go to the Ducati factory so I planned our trip mostly on the north side. But then he mentioned ""it seems like it would be a miss to not see Rome and the colosseum."" I had planned more for Bologna, day trip to Milan, and then a couple days in cinq Terre and Venice. We could fly into Rome and do that as well, it's just further away. We're only planning on spending maybe a week in Italy and then head to croatia."
lfh2ray,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I love Italy, went to so many places, Naples was one of my favorite but I was very close to getting robbed. Sicily is my favorite, Bologna was a sleeper hit, and Naples was awesome"
lfh7nqo,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"We have lived in the North for close to a year now as retirees. No scamming, no mocking my very elementary or my husband’s nearly non existent Italian. 

We just got back from a vacation area where we spent four nights over our anniversary. Beautiful. More expensive than where we live, but not shockingly so. The main difference, other than the clear water beaches on the Adriatic, was that the prevalence of Swiss and Austrian tourists had people asking if we’d prefer they speak in German (tedesco) before they asked if we wanted English. 

We are saving roughly 100% of what we’d spend living very modestly in the US. Despite a to go pizza, a restaurant trip and one or two coffees or glasses of wine each a week. 

We are definitely OK with all the people who think that Italy is a hotbed of crime, because it keeps them away."
lfho54l,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,Dude I work with arrived in Italy a few months ago. Was in the country less than two weeks and got robbed at gunpoint in downtown Naples. It's nothing insanely common and dude was out waaaaaaaay too late for that neighborhood but don't pretend it doesn't exist here either because you were here a couple weeks cruising the tourist areas. lol
lfihrur,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Just my 2 cents: when planning to come to Italy, don't rush and pretend to visit everything at once. Schedule your visit by ""areas"" (northern, central, southern and islands) and stuck  with that plan. Here we have high speed trains that made big cities very close to each other (Naples is 1 hour far from Rome, Rome is 4 hours far from Venice and Milan, Bologna is less then 4 hours from Naples), like it was a national subway (except for the most southern and island areas), but if you really wanna enjoy and really ""breathe"" the atmosphere in, than take it slow and save it for a new journey in the future. I do the same when I travel abroad."
lfke1w2,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"If you want thing to be Stollen, you have to go to Germany"
lfyw1cq,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I love Italy, even with its faults. And what country doesn’t have faults? It’s one of the only places where I can imagine living outside from my home. Last month, I was in Grosetto, and my wife and I walked from our agriturismo to the village. A lot of the locals were having an evening passegiata, kids were having gelato, old men were playing cards and drinking coffee. It was perfecto."
lfckkt3,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"People tend to amplify negative experiences while failing to focus on the positive. I’ve had two delayed flights, a flat tire, and the WiFi isn’t working in my rental home. I’m also looking out the windows at a beautiful sea sparkling in the sun. Life is good, and I can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else."
lfclpwm,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,Live in Italy all year. Nothing bad happened.
lfcojwb,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I lived in Italy for 40 years...
None of those things happened to me either.... 😆"
lfd0lxk,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Why are people so insecure about this? Someone had a bad time, need to make sure that literally no one is deterred from going to Italy? Worried that people think you are exaggerating how great of a time you had?"
lfcf2er,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Thank you for this! This forum is pretty unbelievable. I am a 57 yo American working in London, and my wife and I intend to retire to Italy. We spend almost all of our holidays there (at least 4 weeks a year), and have over the last 10 years visited almost every region including spending more than a week each in Naples and Palermo, and numerous trips for my work and holiday in Rome. This year includes Rome, Ponza, Amalfi, Le Marche, Umbria, and Calabria. Not only has none of this ever happened to me, it has never happened to anyone I know. Obviously crime exists in Italy, as it does in the US, UK and everywhere else. But this forum is mostly just sensationalistic fan fiction. My biggest worry is finding a semi-rural community to retire in with access to an English speaking doctor (which is apparently not a problem at all), and sorting out the double taxation issues."
lfc5qkw,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,I had a similar experience a month ago. Might do it again in the future.
lfc9a0p,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I was also in the Bari airport train that another poster said to have been assaulted in just a few days ago. Nothing happened. 

The highest point were a group of girls that said  they thought they had a million Euro idea where they bought the ticket for the next station after the airport which was a few euros instead of 5.30, only to discover thet had gates at the airport station where they needed to show the tickets. Lol"

lfet5bi,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I don’t understand why people are so defensive and offended when people report any negative thing about Italy.   
I went earlier this year and someone from our group did get their wallet stolen. There were also a lot of annoying salesman trying to sell you trinkets and a few rude people.  

  But I would still go back it was an amazing place. You gotta take the good with the bad. No place is perfect and there is no need to pretend that bad things don’t happen there. "
lff6ayb,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,So you did get scammed
lffa3fj,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,I love how wholesome this post is.
lffrkw9,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I visited. Its an incredible country, although i think some of the locals are fed-up with the quantities of tourists. The issues i had were the restaurants. Some were sneaky with adding cover charges, and adding extra charges (charged us 2kg for a steak that they originally told us would be 1.4kg). Apparently, restaurants dont serve tap water. I probably spent $300 on water alone."

lfgi7ax,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,I had to leave Bellagio due an emergency early in the morning and realized that buses don't run until 8 am. Had to take a taxi from Bellagio to Como for 100 euro. I had no choice but to agree to that exorbitant rate.

Sometimes it takes a few days or, in rare cases, multiple vacation's, until your presence has been noted by local authorities (Cosanostra) and the paperwork is done.


However be sure that the long arm will reach you, either remote or at your next stay.

All pretty harmless, pretty good holidays.

I'm happy that I drove for 10 years in Montreal, Canada. Now to me traffic around or in Rome, Florence, or Napoli was easier for me to read and handle - just without using any hand signs or the horn, still have to learn that."
lfk4c2k,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Just one thing:
The +0.20 per liter wasn't a tourist tax.

Apparently, staff from the agency in agreement with a few day garages the kind who serves hotels intercepted the cars to get away (often with luggages etc) to put up a thieves scheme. In a word, the client was charged for a lot while the car could reappear shortly after undamaged. If the tourist was going in one of those places, he was done, they knew he was told to leave the car where they could serve him right.

lfcca2q,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Too bad it is the big news when you don't get stabbed in the back in Italy. Get some longer exposure times. You can maybe join the mainstream.

lfcknof,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I think there's a saying that goes : good experiences you tell 5 people. Bad experiences you tell 500. 

This sub has started to become a WBMC sub (Whine Bitch Moan Complain) about everything that's possibly negative and less and less about travel questions. A post about getting robbed gets 200 replies and an inquiry about a <general travel> question gets 5. Go figure.

Glad you had a great time 👍"
lfcow80,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,Same! Just got back and had nothing but a good experience!!!! Was it warm.. yes but it's expected for July 😂. Felt very safe even walking home at 3am!!!
lfcp3xy,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,Appreciate this sarcasm!  Italy is a wonderful country to visit and full of amazing people and places.  People posting about robberies and other crime should not discourage  anyone.
lfcy8ff,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Travelled first time to Italy this summer.

- paid 12€ for Ice Cream (2 Scoops)
- Someone broke into our vehicle and robbed us.
- I drove into a ZTL because I didn't know what it was (everything is written in Italian). I didn't suspect anything, as other vehicles also drove into it. I will probably have to pay hundreds of euros in fines"
lfcyjmr,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I am a solo female traveller and was in Italy for two weeks.

My sincere advice is to be aware of your surroundings. Also, when visiting any of the tourist areas, make sure to not carry any items that you would regret losing if you were to be a victim of any sort of crime."
lfd48dh,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,For us Europeans this post just confirms how naive/unrealistic some non-Europeans are when they cone to any European destination. Is that what they thought you at school? That outside your country all other countries are inhabitated by violent barbarians?

Had a back pack with lots of water n some small towels. And you don’t need your passport like everyone says. Only for hotel check in. License works fine everywhere and Apple Pay n cards. Only exchanged 500 euro and still have spare left. Rome, Naples, Florence, Munich (my 3 girls are swifties). Venice tomorrow n back to Rome for a day n fly to NY Saturday. 14 days in all. FREENOW in Rome is best for taxi. But your Hotel can call you one even faster. We stayed at CitizenM hotel in Rome. Donati in Florence and MODI in Munich. Still have to book Venice for next 3 days. Let me know if anyone has questions. And No One cares about your shoes or clothing brands AT ALL. You are a tourist and so is everyone else at places you go. Leave the fancy clothes n shoes at home. I learnt the hard way lol"

lfd0ok7,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I visited Lecco last weekend and had a LOVELY time. It was my first time in Italy. I flew into Malpensa, and took a couple trains to Lecco.

""ciao"" and ""bona serra"".... I survived Leccco extremely well with that, and found most people spoke way more English than I expected. It's a beautiful town."

It just requires a modem of common sense.  I lived in NYC and heard the same kind of stories about crime there before I moved 
 and never felt unsafe on the streets. This is not to safe that stuff does not happen because it does. It just means that you need to learn to walk with authority and keep your eyes open."
lfddba4,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"Ehi OP I want to hear more about the tourist trap at the gas station. What happened? Do you mean the 0,2 cent/litre that they charge you if they did the gas for you? In this case is not a tourist trap, it's a regular Italian shame. Like the taxi lobby (no Uber in Italy) and the private beach lobby."
lfddusn,t3_1ee7uu2,1ee7uu2,"I had the same experience. I see a pattern here that is different from others…. Hmm

lfi6oca,t1_lfcd1wt,1ee7uu2,"The worst drivers in Italy are Germans AND Swiss.

Apparently they only abide by road rules in their countries and consider  Italy a racetrack.

And it is not a matter of not knowing the roads. Those punks are constantly speeding, parking where it’s not allowed and basically making a nuisance of themselves.

They probably miss the irony, considering the virtue signaling and the bullshit they pull just after customs. I am referring to 30km/h speed limits near Sondrio, with tickets worth thousands of Francs issued to Italians, with the choice of jail time. Guys, we really should reciprocate.

And FYI, when people from northern Italy see a driver pulling some shit maneuver, we usually say “é uno svizzero”.

You thinking that Italians are aggressive drivers it is probably some kind of provincial “we are better than you” delusion. Or projecting.

As someone who has owned a B&B on Lake Garda for almost a decade, I can confirm that there is bad people and good people everywhere."
lfh760p,t1_lfcd1wt,1ee7uu2,the most unexpected thing is that the fastest speeders on the highways are those displaying a Ticino plate… Morons on wheels.

Germans are worse drivers than Italians, but Italians drive much faster. I’m in the north of Italy right now, and if you don’t drive 20-30 over the speed limit people will flash at you and overtake you. Overall they are much more predictable and more kind, but definitely drive faster. Germans are ego drivers."

Italians are by far the worst drivers on the entire planet, hands down and it's not even close to #2. And I'm talking Milan and Monza drivers, if you go to the south that's not driving. 

But then you can't say a thing to them about this, it's like telling them their pasta lacked some salt. Obnoxious inferiority complex from an entire population if you ask me"

This is the problem with italians mostly. You first generalize, but at the end you end up saying ""there is bad people and good people everywhere."", clear inferiority complex because you make great cars and bla bla bla

That italians are the #1 worst drivers on the EU is a very well funded stereotype, and you must know that if you owned property in lake garda.

Different places have different cultures and you cherry-pick a few things that, while not rare in Italy, may be less common than in the US. Especially if you're going around cities full of tourists. 

I lived in Italy my entire life and never had someone steal me a table, I helped multiple people with their luggage (to be fair once I think a guy thought I was about to rob him), and saw tons of elderly get a seat.

That's not true. 

Fines are equal for everyone. However, if your speeding exceeds a certain threshold, you can be charged with a crime. In this case - and just in this case - for your first offence you get a financial penalty and you're put in probation. This financial penalty is a certain number of ""daily rates"" (usually between 15 and 60) which are based on your daily income.

Alpine pass, my mom is driving her ""sleeper"" Citroen Berlingo, I'm sitting beside her. We catch up to a swiss BMW, not a sports car but definitely faster than her super spacious 3 kids + dog + luggage transportation device.

She stays behind for a while, all while saying, word for word:

""Perché freni in curva e acceleri in rettilineo, non sai proprio guidare"" (Why do you slow down on turns and accelerate on straights, you clearly can't drive)
""Ma dalla a me!"" (Mad about the fact that the car that's making her waste 2 minutes of her precious time, she asks the driver in front to swap cars so she can show him how to drive it)

Follows super risky overtake, then we go 30+ kmh faster than the speed limit just to let go of frustration.
Little she knows, she's catching up to a german Audi going even slower.

Let's just say, my mom taught me how to drive fast, definitely not how to drive safe.
Luckily my father is a bit safer so I was also taught that, if not I don't know where I'd be.

I’m Asian and I will attest that Americans are more likely to be open, welcoming and kind on average than Euros.

This has happened multiple times in SF. Homeless man ran after me to return my roller bag after I was exhausted and left it behind when I was stepping off the train. People in the US are usually mindful of others in crowds and will endeavor to let others pass if you say excuse me. There are definitely some cities which are ruder than others but in general overall demeanor in the US is more pleasant. You can also talk readily to people and befriend them more easily.

I mean this lady on the train even said when someone offered to help her “you must be American you’re the first person to ask if I need help” and went on to say how many times she’d been to Italy. I was trying to sit down at Osteria Da Filo in Venice when some lady literally sprinted over and pulled the chair out from the table we had already approached without even asking or caring, while I was telling my wife I’ll run in you sit down but she snatched it without care. Then barged inside moments later and starts walking around me as I’m waiting to order and grabs the other guy who was finishing something (her friend held the table). Lining up at the airport or train several times people tried to be orderly but then folks just decide f it and walk right up to the front of the line and crowd around. Never saw one person ask an elderly who had to stand by the doors and luggage storage if they’d like to sit down. The one time we sat close to that kind of situation I pointed at my seat but he refused. I had people - what felt like purposely - decide to walk onto the sidewalk only after they were a few feet from us, forcing us to move out of the way. In the galleria in Milan two girls were standing to the side talking and a lady literally decided to walk  right in between them, close enough they touched. On an early morning hike of Cinque Terre the skilled guys that fix the stone walls were working, looked up at us as we approached and I said Buongiorno to which they just ignored me and went back to looking down. I finished by saying oh wow how lucky are we to see you guys working (I’ve heard it’s a rare skill only a few still do) They just continued to ignore me. Shrug. And in crowds permesso, scusate, and scusi never worked. When I’d see a couple trying to take a photo real quick I’d go around or wait, just to watch the people behind me walk right in front of them. Anyway just a few of many examples. I’m sure people don’t love tourists. On the other hand we had great service and loved any Italian we actually interacted with."

Just my observation and the minute I got home the friendliness really stuck out compared to being in Italy. Sorry you don't like it. I gave actual examples I dealt with. If it helps, there were tons of European tourists around so maybe Europeans in general aren't the most considerate when in public. I had enough examples that it was incredibly noticeable. And as I mentioned, dealing with actual Italians one-on-one was great. A little Italian goes a long way and they are incredibly accommodating/helpful.

Italian government and minister are very conscious of our bad habits to be ""Schumacher of Reggio Emilia 😂"" or every other place, and they set ridiculous speed limits and stops just to prevent in the first place. And that's utterly correct if u ask me.

But again, if the road allows it, conditions are good and a road with max speed 70 km/h, u have a car in front of you going at 30 km/h, bc she/he wanna go easy, with all the rights to do it, i just surpass and let her going easy.
I'm not a psycho and u are stopping everyone else to go 50 km/h for example, which would be absolutely good.

Cameras is put as a deterrent, 7 outta 10 are bad positioned or turned off. But nobody wanna gamble on them rightly so, so when u see them u instantly go on decelerate. Only ones really working and always verified if working, are ""The tax one"". Those are the inevitable ones bc gov bring up soooo much money from them.

In Rome we have ""preferenziale"" where only Bus and Taxi can go, major part of them are not covered by cameras. But i have one near my house, that's literally a bancomat. 
It requires u to put just one wheel on the yellow line and taac , 85 euros. Once i put myself outthere in the street watching how many crosses that, and i couldn't believe Municipio racked up like 886euros in 35 seconds.

I actually woke up one morning in Milan in June, drove 2 hours to the Cervino (it’s the Matterhorn, other side of Zermatt), skied on the glacier for 4 hours, took the car and 2 hours later I was in Portofino with my family for aperitif and dinner.

I remember visiting as a teenager on a school trip and something stuck with me. Only last year did I decide to go back and it honestly changed my life. The places I’ve been, the people I’ve met and the amount of gelato I’ve consumed! I wouldn’t change it for the world. 

Firenze is one of my favourite places, I could spend hours just aimlessly walking around. Being able to go down a random street and look up to a beautiful, aged piece of art just truly makes me appreciate life. 

Enjoying a spritz and cigarette (which I also don’t normally smoke) and being able to relax midday without any judgment, should just be a way of life for everyone. 

Sitting out on a balcony and watching the sunset over the Tuscan hills or a group of friends singing after a night out in Milano, honestly both warm my heart.

The culture of travelers and meeting different people from all over and having great conversations. 20 years later I am still traveling every chance I get to explore new areas and cities in Europe, and it’s still a bummer when I land in my home city airport and everyone seems miserable and it’s an endless sprawl of parking lots, strip malls and chain restaurants.

On your feelings of history and cultures, yes any country that has ancient history, and especially history that is tied to the actual group of people who reside there, will almost always be better. It's the same feeling in Japan, (historic) China, Korea, (historic) India, et al.

The United States has a limited history but had a time where there were actually quite amazing wonders of architecture rivaling cities like Rome and France. Instead of cherishing them, the country decided to bull doze, raze, and cover up almost all of those builds and amazing works. Gone is most of the stone, marble, and truly gorgeous work... Only to be replaced by steel, concrete, and glass in an ever-increasing race to fit more people into far smaller spaces, because we need more money for less effort.

Couple that with a forced focus on travelling by car in a nation that is larger than Europe, you ***will*** feel like there is a lack of amazing historical sites, when in fact there are many. But, the ability to access them in a manner like walking Rome is simply impossible for most of the places."

I know my country, my nation, my region. I know it's most obscure parts. In the past, in the present, in the foreseeable future. I know them very well.
I hate, I **strongly hate**, certain...things. Dynamics. Cultural cancers. Call it what you want; It's that kind of hate that comes from love. Think about Rome (while we are at it...). Think about how beautiful she is, yet how much more beautiful she could be.
I don't want to get much longer because otherwise there would be so much to say, we could go on for months. Just...everything considered, I wouldn't change it with anything else, except a better version of it. For which I strive, and I will work as much as I can.

Tonight it's particular. Elections in the US.
I love many things about US. I hate many others in the same amount, maybe a bit more, I don't know, it depends. Right now to me it seems like some sorta of stripped down Inferno.
Same thing, in a certain way, with Japan, same with many other great countries and parts of our beautiful world.

lvoqkcc,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"That's the attitude that makes you enjoy the life.
I bet you were cool and open and that reflects in the way people interact with you,.
Worth some exceptions, naturally,  people usually mirror your way of presenting yourself. 
I always say that a smile can bring you a long way. 

And congrats on having tried oxtail (i presume you mean coda alla vaccinara ) is a undiscovered and awesome typical roman dish,  always overlooked by the more mainstream carbonara or amatriciana. But if done well... it's heaven on a plate."

lvqxw73,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"Excellent to read this. The true benefit of travel is it opens the eyes and mind if done properly. It is a very good thing to know that you had this experience. And Rome is a fine place, even more so beyond the usual tourist track. May fortune follow you in your future travels."
lvrd8e7,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,I am an American living in Italy (just over a year now) and I would stay forever if I could. The things I miss about the US aren’t worth giving up everything I love about in Italy.

lvzo1wc,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"I couldn’t dislike this post and the comments here enough. I’m from Rome, I found a job 3 years ago that pays unreasonably well so I’m forced to stay because if you know you know, the job market in Italy is messed up; I have been saving up like crazy because I’ve been trying to find a house for myself and my partner for 3 years now, and they’re all up for short-term rents. You guys don’t understand that Italy is not la dolce vita, people live here, we want to work here, if rich tourists keep coming in bunches and the prices of every commodity keep skyrocketing, we’ll just end up being stupid cardboard cutouts to your beautiful stupid vacations. Think about it. Stop promoting whatever this is, for real.
PS before anyone says anything about “but tourism gives you jobs!!!!!” no it doesn’t. I don’t wanna work as a slave (underpaid waiter, cook, maid, receptionist, you name it?) to make your vacations better."
lw1ny70,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,I lived in Rome all my life and your view on the city is really refreshing for me. I really appreciated your post thanks for sharing your thoughts!
lw1unyq,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"I love your thoughts. I too felt this way in Italy! People were so friendly and even if not friendly, respectful! I miss Italy so much too. Also my great grandpa was Italian so I feel a connection there. I hope you can go back soon!"

lw38u0n,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,I live here as of a year and a half ago. I agree with everything you said. All the reasons I moved here permanently.
lw3mggx,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"You may want to consider smaller cities or villages if you ever go back, on my trip I hit the crazy you talk about in your thread, but I also went to cities like Bari and small villages like Volturara Appula and got an authentic feel for what it is like to live in Italy... just a thought."
lw3nrd5,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"I live in Italy. I find your passion interesting and inspiring. My only advice to you and others who feel similarly is to create your own Italy wherever you are, in ways small and large. What does this mean? I am not sure. Somehow, live more like an Italian. Grow a garden so you can make great salads. Open a small cafe on Main Street? Have gatherings of friends in your backyard...and cook. Buy an old Vespa? One thing I know for sure is work to revitalize whatever Main Street downtown you have. Buy a building there. Live there. Italians live in six-storey apartment buildings with stores on the ground floor. Did you notice that? If they lived in single family houses, the cities would be quite boring as in USA, Canada etc. Ahh but you don't want to live on top of each other... oh well."
lw5j51l,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,Who doesn’t love Italy? 🥹 It’s truly the most magical country in the world and the only place I’ve ever really felt at home. Couldn’t be more proud to be from Italy ❤️

lvif1gf,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"Consider moving here, and you’ll quickly see the challenges of living in this place beyond the rosy picture often painted by visitors. Dealing with bureaucracy, government processes, healthcare, and securing a decent wage for local work can be quite difficult. Having lived here for four years across various cities, I can certainly appreciate the positive aspects, but the realities of everyday life are much more complex than what one experiences on a holiday."
lvj6vel,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"Totally agree with your comments. Currently in Ferenzi, having recently been in Napoli and Roma. Haved loved every second, from the wonderful crazy streets of Napoli to the more serene Ferenzi. I would never go home if I could stay. Love the history, architecture and people. It's been a dream holiday."
lvieh0d,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"I’m traveling in Italy now and love it, but these nonsensical, performative train strikes every couple weeks have now left me stranded twice. I’m staying just outside Milan and every train into the city is canceled until 4:59, torpedoing my day.

lvk6cob,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,"It's easy to enjoy Italy as a tourist, your pockets filled with dollars.

Reality is much bleaker for us Italians, an entire generation (roughly 25-40 yo) left their birthplace to move to the Northern rich cities, or to live abroad.

Country is filled with aging population and the culture is stagnating because of that, issues like racism, homophobia and misogyny are deeply entrenched in traditional Italian culture, starting with our politicians. 

We love Italy, except for the fact is inhabited by Italians."
lvpa00d,t3_1gjpikt,1gjpikt,Hey is there another Italy I've never heard of? This one you're describing is very different from the one I live in.

lvzbg83,t1_lvkobr1,1gjpikt,yes bro we are probably very reckless but we have learned to drive on very narrow and very steep roads and trust me now we can drive anywhere in the world. I challenge you to drive on certain alleys in Rome or certain streets in Sicilian villages.
lym8tez,t1_lvkobr1,1gjpikt,"Cabbies in Naples and associated areas. In a rainstorm. Holy f—.


Seriously, mad respect. It's such a strange thing to put your life into someone's hands and by the end of a 40km ride (to Gricignano) 100% trust their driving abilities, be confident they'd easily rival the defensive/evasive driving professionals in your home county... and probably get arrested for reckless driving at the same time. 


In a rainstorm. And at night for the second driver.

lvg9z5e,t1_lvfhe8m,1gjpikt,"vatican was pretty deserted when I went, I even got to sit down in the Sistine chapel and stare for a few minutes before moving on.

lvk9rjt,t1_lvfhe8m,1gjpikt,"Oh boy do I not miss the crowds of the Vatican, the crowds of the center of Rome (and especially in the Coliseum), the crowds in the center of Florence or the crowds of San Marco's Basilica in Venice (it wasn't crowded in the city itself). Oh and I almost forgot the subway of Rome, it was almost comedically full, and as bad as Tokyo during peak hour.

We loved Italy but we'd also love to go back and that time, now that this major touristic stuff is out of the way, focus on other less touristic cities and regions. Something like Sicily in March."
lvl3tn2,t1_lvib1kq,1gjpikt,"when close to 100% of teenage culture and online drama are birthed from the US, it rubs off on the society as a whole."
lvl3e0m,t1_lvid6w7,1gjpikt,"im kinda already retired in a way here. Like, my house and car are paid off and I make a decent salary from the interest on my index fund. Thats why I am not too concerned about ""wages"" for now, as shitty as that sounds. I feel bad having to bypass the struggle that even most natives go through, and I am no stranger to jobs like waiting, bussing, washing dishes, working with my hands in general, but if I could establish myself now and use the money I have to get a good career in Italy, I feel like id get by quite well. Im not a fancy car or big house kind of guy, I really wouldnt need much to be happy when I am surrounded by places like I was in Rome or Florence.

My airbnb host in florence said many flats around the suburbs of Florence are 450-700 euro, which is roughly 550-900 USD. Thats waaaay better than I thought, and if I rent out my house while I am gone its even cheaper. 

taxes are much better here in the US, most people pay 12-18% federal with less for their state, but good luck getting a decent state sponsored social plan unless youre a single mother. Healthcare, although quick and cheap-ish if you have a job with a good plan, is hell financial wise for most people. the metro outside of the two or three largest cities isnt even a joke, it just doesnt exist, and housing cost is getting just as bad as everywhere else which makes no sense because we have sooooo much open space. Groceries are still okay where I am but theres nothing but farm land around my city, and after covid every major company is looking to gouge people with no government protection. Our democracy is slow because we have two major parties, one that wants to keep the shitty status quo and the other thats working to make things even worse."
lvivz8y,t1_lvipmm9,1gjpikt,"Most Italians love Italy, the problem lies in the ever increasing living costs: low wages, expensive housing, worsening welfare. Many mention bizantine bureaucracy, safety, transportation and other stuff, but those are largely overrated, it really only is a money problem."
lvkti56,t1_lvkb38f,1gjpikt,"I was raised in the country side back home, so I will admit I could see myself getting a little homesick for it, seems like the country I passed through on the way from Rome to Florence on the high speed rail might be the cure for that."

lvl8aas,t1_lvkvfqf,1gjpikt,"I am sooo in to shearling jackets, when I went to florence I was blown away at the amount of leather and fur jackets and how cheap they were, every other girl and a fair amount of guys just had the most amazing coats and jackets, swag everywhere. This one vintage store I went to had this full length arctic fox power coat for like 1000 euro, which is insane because even vintage a coat like that would retail at at least 5000 USD, typically closer to 10k USD. I almost bought this great shearling bomber jacket for like 200 euro, it was just slightly too big for me. But its my dream gift for myself so next time im in Florence I am getting one."
lvzwz92,t1_lvzo1wc,1gjpikt,"it is nonsense and stupid to blame tourists for that. Tourist could be a positive thing if politicians make the right rules to administrate it. There are 8+ billions people on earth, a lot of them eager to travel. Do you think everyone should first think:  ""Should I go visit Italy or I risk to upset someone if a do it...""
cmon be real.
Blame the politicians you vote, not people who love to travel."
lw0nf1c,t1_lvzo1wc,1gjpikt,"i mean, maybe you dont want to, but for some people it is literally ""either this job exists because of tourism and I can get it, or no jobs exist at all"". With the vastly declining birth rates, you really shouldnt be discouraging anyone from wanting to come and try to make a life or giving the money they earned to your economy."
lw1zbzf,t1_lvzo1wc,1gjpikt,"You are not all of Italy. Whether you are Italian or an expat, you are projecting your experience on the OP, and it’s wrong. 

If you live in Rome, of course things will be more costly. 

We live in Veneto, where our upstairs neighbors in a fourplex are a tailor and a delivery driver who own a 120sm condo with a double garage and a view of the Dolomites.

It took us a very long time to be able to get to Italy as residents, instead of visiting our daughter. And I am grateful that this country accepted us, and that we live in a place where graciousness is an expectation, not a lucky accident."

lvl68de,t1_lvi74kk,1gjpikt,"well as youve probably seen, the jubilee is gonna be kicking off so expect big crowds, but by december id imagine a lot of the construction will be wrapping up. You are about a month out which is a proper time to book most tickets, vatican will probably be harder, but so so so many people at my hostel didnt book anything and ended up just waiting in line, if you can stomach a 1-2 hour line (the earlier you go the better), you really dont need to book much if youre fine with doing that. But the vatican musuems, the colosseum (get the attico third floor if you can, first two floors are mad packed ), and the borghese gallery are the major ones. Then you have stuff like the pantheon which you just walk up to and get tickets and get in and out within half an hour. My personal favorite things, besides what I mentioned already, were Castel San'Angelo (the angels peak was the best view of the city) and the crypt of the Capuchin Friars (if you like dead bodies stacked in ornate positions)."

lvjp32v,t1_lvieh0d,1gjpikt,"How do you know they are not striking for good reasons? Employees who strike do not get paid, and even with strong unions striking is a risk.

Right now, they are striking because one train conductor was stabbed on the job."

lvnrd65,t1_lviehmq,1gjpikt,"As a person who literally lives in Romes, i have to tell you: you are right about transport, its pretty miserable. But everything else you're saying is beyond non-sense. ""Poor food"" what are you on? Did you keep falling for tourist traps or something?"
lvvnr2o,t1_lviehmq,1gjpikt,"Sorry but I have to disagree. I was born and raised in Rome and lived in Venice for the past two years. Every touristic city has a lot of tourist traps, but even in Venice you can find very good and traditional restaurants. The problem there is that those are still quite expensive and very few compared to the touristic ones.
Rome is a very different story. Has a big culinary tradition and many many authentic places. And it’s also one of the cheapest city for food. You can easily have a very good and traditional dinner for 15/20€. Also it is a huge city, one the biggest European metropolis, full of suburban and non touristic neighborhoods so it’s absurd to think that you can’t find good food in the whole city.
And if you think that Puglia it’s the pinnacle of food in Italy you are very wrong. Right know it is the most touristic region and it’s getting harder and harder to eat properly (and prices are raising)."
lvj9lvs,t1_lviehmq,1gjpikt,Poor food? Wtf
lvm8dg8,t1_lviehmq,1gjpikt,"Thats so true. I lived in Rome & I hated it. As a tourist it's one amazing place. But you don't wanna live there. To live Italy has waaay better places to offer than Rome. Find Trento, Bolzano, even Verona."
lvplfxk,t1_lviehmq,1gjpikt,I visited there during Covid too. Only 6 other people in the Sistine chapel with us. It was fantastic. I would never go there in the Summer. a mob scene.

And, thank you for your kind words. You made me reevaluate where I live. I hope you'll come back and have other great experiences. Italy is so different and full of stuff to see do. In 40 years I still have to visit a lot of places"

lvk5omh,t1_lvjq8is,1gjpikt,I don't understand.
lvqemvm,t1_lvm2z3a,1gjpikt,"I'm not really sure, but it's not like the siren has any special meaning. I think it's just that it's such a common sound, especially in Rome, that you start getting used to it. But the effect it had on us is like when you smell or taste something that takes you back to a special place from your childhood. So, I think that's it—it’s a kind of nostalgic feeling.

After we got back, we were on a mission to find a gelato or pistachio cream that could match what we had in Italy, and when we found something close, it brought back that same feeling. It was pretty funny!

And I have to mention, my girlfriend was feeling really emotional about everything that day, so that probably added to the ""almost crying"" moment, lol

There's just so much that made Italy special for us. We both have Italian ancestors, and we grew up hearing family talk about how amazing Italy and Italians are. It was our first international trip, we both love pasta and Italian food, and coming from Brazil, the cultural difference was mind-blowing. We saw so many things that are older than our country! And for me especially, as an architecture graduate, seeing and learning about Renaissance art and history was incredible.

The most amazing thing, though, was experiencing how Italy acknowledges my disability. It’s not recognized back home, so I’m not used to getting any special consideration. In Italy, I was treated so kindly, and it took me a while to get used to it. I actually cried when I got back to my hotel after three or four days.

But imagine paying 50% in taxes (beside everything else, like taxes on property, car, crazy amount of insurance), expecting to retire at 70 because the state is dumb, and then the roads suck, fast trains are super rare and super expensive, the highway is super expensive and they are always working on it, public offices are a joke and they are full of old people who don't know how to do anything, doing literally anything involving processing takes a day just to get thru the burocracy, then can take months to process, corruption everywhere, politicians barfing idiocy everywhere, a school system that sucks the will to love out of you, and a bunch more things. Then you get home, you turn on the tv, you put on the state TV (which we pay for, once it was a tax no one paid, now they make you pay it on the electricity bill) and they talk about the pope?

I’m not from Rome, I live in Naples (1 hour by fast train, 2:20 hours by car) and I can make you sure that food in Rome is amazing, but only if you know someone who lives in Rome.
The historical city center is a tourist trap basically; there are many nice spots outside (both for the food and the city itself), but how could you find them out alone? They are above all residential districts.
The best travel tip is: find a friend in Rome lol

There are so many tourists that online reviews are not trustable because probably there are more tourists than locals and you can’t find easily good restaurants.

lvs5bco,t1_lvmhusn,1gjpikt,Bravo. It is a touristic destination since the 3 century BC!
lvnzlcx,t1_lvnw9xd,1gjpikt,"You just made 2 big mistakes.

The first: if you like the food in Puglia and Tuscany so be it, no need to say food in another place is shit because in Puglia the treccia is better. Contrary to the US, when you move province by province food is vastly different, so it's ok to prefer food from another region. (i.e.: I am not a fan of food in Puglia, way too heavy, but I'd NEVER say it's bad).

The second: if you like big steaks, like it appears you do, Roman food is definitely not for you. And your local friends, unless they're 16, should have told you.

Overpriced according to who? To NY? To London? To Sydney? What exactly are you on? Food in Rome is the cheapest of any major European capital and by far, the better.

If you compare the prices of a restaurant in a central district of Rome to one located in a small town in the Chianti region, yes, prices would be quite different, but careful with the use of 'overpriced', otherwise you're just showing that your 'local mates' are not really helping finding you good restaurants to dine in."
lvo076j,t1_lvnzlcx,1gjpikt,"Let me explain my job l actually review cars, hotels and food around the globe. Central Rome the food is not as good as outside Rome. It's very different to Tuscany and Puglia l live in Italy and that is the luxury problem l have access to great diverse Italian food. Every time this year l have gone to Rome and including my family the last restaurant famous we were told next to Valentino the food was disgusting. The waiters were Italian which was refreshing to be served. And one of my cousins is a chef we are talking about basic food here. My friend lives in Rome and l am always telling to.stop taking me too crap food places."
lvo0dq7,t1_lvnzlcx,1gjpikt,Give us your top central Rome eating places please just good basic pasta and pizza let's start there.
lvo5njs,t1_lvo076j,1gjpikt,"You review cars, hotels and food, thus you're no expert in either of those.

You say you have local mates, but no local mate would take you for dinner around the Trevi fountain or next to Valentino, even a toddler knows that. But your cousin is a chef and he took you there? Is he working at Subway?

And another mistake: you just asked to name a few pasta-pizza places. That's a big no-no. That means you have no idea what you're talking about. It means you have no respect for the italian cousine. 

No expert, or enthusiast, would ever use the term pasta-pizza places. That vulgar term is for those ignorant Yankees that complain each time the amount of Parmesan is not the same as Olive Garden.

Apologies darling for my sarcasm, but something about you is not right here. Try again."
lvozi8n,t1_lvo0dq7,1gjpikt,"pasta and pizza are not everything that makes an italian menu, stop doing this it's ridiculous, and let an italian talk about this please.

i was born in Bollate (MI) just do you need proof, so i lived here for 22 years now and i could know some stuff that a ""car hotel food reviewer"" might not know.

Rome, Florence, Milan, Puglia, Naples WHEREVER you go you can find overprized restaurants or good restaurants with good prices, you just have to search for 'em, the best places are a bit far from the center of the touristic destination, never go to ""the restaurant IN FRONT of colosseo"" because it's obvious you're gonna fall into a tourist trap :/

that's it. it doesn't depend on the place, italy is a food country, every region has it's special dishes  and history to discover."

lvp2etb,t1_lvozi8n,1gjpikt,That is what this post is all about Rome and tourism wake up Italy is all about tourism it depends on it.

So for long outings I have a small mobility scooter. My wife and I were in Italy last year and wanted to tour the Vatican grounds etc. We had the poor timing to go on a Sunday right before the pope came out to address everyone so it was enormously crowded l, lines to wait everywhere. The line to get inside the grounds snaked so far back along a rough sidewalk that I couldn’t see any way to get to it even with my scooter’s help. So I resigned myself to just sit near a barricade and just watch what was going on inside. 

After a few minutes this burly police man gestured for me to come closer and he just moved the barricade so I could get in without having to deal with the line on uneven sidewalk. I was so grateful for the gesture!"

At first he was clearly more interested in watching the crowd, but once he found out that I spoke a little Italian it quickly became a driving lesson, complete with where to look for signs and street names in the historic center. By the end of it he had the energy of an old friend. It was really a great welcome to Italy experience (one of many).    
  
My first interaction was a passport check on a train my first day of my first visit... There were 3 carabinieri who walked into the car and must have pegged me for an American right away. They circled my seat and all 3 started barking orders at me- passport, hurry up, you'd better, etc. I was absolutely terrified because of my previous interactions with American police, but it only lasted a few seconds before they started laughing and telling me they were joking, welcoming me to the country, asking what my travel plans were and giving me pointers for the small town I was on the way to visit."
lt6y2f0,t3_1g84nbr,1g84nbr,"I will add another positive experience…my husband and I visited the small town where one of my ancestors lived, just for me to see it. Like the bunch of American idiots that we are, we got flustered with all of the pedestrian streets and stairways and turned up a wrong way and directly into the path of a local police car.  I thought for sure we were going to get a ticket.  We rolled down  the window and basically tried to say we didn’t know what we were doing in broken Italian. As if that wasn’t clear! He was very nice and tried to give us directions to send us on our way (to a destination which made zero sense based on where we were—you don’t go there from there! I think maybe we just threw him completely off by our nonsensical situation)  I’m sure we made for great dinner table conversation for a lot of people that evening."
lt10q4y,t1_lsw085h,1g84nbr,"Not to discount the kindness, but in Italy - and I assume something similar applies also to the Vatican - is a general rule/law that people with any disability/different needs have the right to skip any line. We're still a very ableist country, but this at least is guaranteed.  And we are not the best accessibility-wise, especially in the ancient parts of the cities.
Also, for the future, in a lot of places if you can prove that you need to have someone with you to assist with mobility needs or if you just have any kind of disability, you will just have to buy one ticket for you and your wife and/or discounts with museums and monuments."

They were wearing vests that were very close to the employees at the check points. Their gig was to show people where the gate area was and ask for money. I ignored them and then explained their game to other people watching the schedule boards. These guys were completely overt, but security just let them operate."

It seemed to me that security/police allow them to be there. Maybe payed them off to allow them to try to scam tourists. It’s unfortunate but gave us a laugh more than anything. Also, just because someone doesn’t experience this, doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. If you’re going on a train with your family all carrying suitcases, chances are they’ll find you!

Just in case anyone's reading this and going to France, too - baggage inspectors ARE a thing on certain FRENCH trains (the ""Ouigo"" budget fast trains). They operate on a ""Ryanair"" principle, so if you're bringing a check-in size bag you have to pay extra when you buy your ticket to put the suitcase on the suitcase rack. If they find your bag on the rack and you haven't paid the baggage fee, then yes you do get fined. Repeat- this is in France, not Italy."

If you report this kind of episodes to the police,if they don't speak English,use a translator and communicate by writing. As an Italian you have the duty to alert and you pay taxes so basically you pay their salary so don't say it's useless,at least try cause you're paying for it."

lf7opa8,t3_1ebsp79,1ebsp79,"Happened to my fiancee and me in Palermo. We were parking and this strange fella 'helped' us park then offered us what appeared to be an expired parking ticket for 50 cents. My fiancée took it and then thought twice. It happened so fast we didn't realize the ticket was expired. He turned around and demanded his money back. The guy insisted the ticket was valid (gas lighter). The ticket machines looked vandalized and were not working (SUS) so we got back in the car and parked a few blocks away. Low and behold another poorly dressed young guy approaches to help and demands a full euro for his services. My fiancee asks ""what services exactly are you providing me?"" He insist he is the watcher of this street and guards all the cars against vandalism. They get into it verbally and my bf takes pictures of his car. He told the guy: "" I'm taking pictures of you and my car and if I see a single scratch I'm taking my American wife to the police station and you are paying to fix it."" The guy had the audacity to feign insulted and said we OWED him a thank you for trying to help us out. We were blocks from the American consulate and there on business with them. Normally my fiancee doesn't interact with these fools but he works 7 days a week and was in some type of mood that morning as we drove 3 hours to get there, running late now because of these jerks. Thankfully our appointment was quick. When we got back the ""street watcher"" avoided us completely and we left immediately. Looking back maybe a euro isn't much, and if you are alone then I suggest just give it up. However if people stop paying these scammers they end up disappearing. Our first scammer was on his Samsung phone watching tik toks while he waited for parking cars. He could find work. (For context my SO is Sicilian born and raised) Somewhere like Catania, my fiancé told me later, you would probably pay those 50 cents because they do scratch the cars right away. They pay kids to do it. Wild."

lf5vk5c,t3_1ebsp79,1ebsp79,"What I've always wondered about these people is what drives them to choose that lifestyle over having a regular job with a monthly salary like most people do. The logical reason for not following societal norms is to get quick and easy benefits at the expense of morals and a victim, but they don't really look like they live a better life than the average worker.

Even if they're not actual criminals but just sell cheap crap on the beach or other informal activities. In all big cities it's common to see adult people walking around the same spot for hours, crossing looks and words with someone else every now and then. It's not clear what they're doing but you can tell they have something going on and they spend the whole day doing it. There's countless physically able people everywhere doing sketchy things and I just can't figure out what benefit they find in doing what they do over finding a job, renting a house, owning a car.. everything that normal people do. Seems much better to me imho.."

lfcf17m,t1_lev1j5z,1ebsp79,"In Italy the police will never ever ask for money unless you are doing something wrong or traveling without a ticket. If that's the case, they will never ever ask for cash. They will write a fine and ask you to pay it via bank transfer or at a post office/police station. Moreover they follow the principle of every police force in the world. If you are polite and nice, they will be polite and nice. If you are confrontational, they'll be less than pleasant. 
Train stations are full of annoying individuals (some straight up criminals), so be particularly careful in the evening or if you're alone.

lfc85ej,t1_lezceiz,1ebsp79,"Unfortunately it is free and it is wrong, they should absolutely charge a price for extra luggages (more than 2for each person) and/or for particularly bulky baggages. It is not fair that often there is not a half centimeter where to put a small bag, while there are tourists who fill entire carriages with their extra large bags, often even obstructing the passage in the corridors, because obviously they are the only ones who exist and they don't care about the others."
lf01s5z,t1_lex1q1h,1ebsp79,Where did this happen exactly? Was it during a stop at like Roma Termini or Napoli Centrale or was it during the actual transit?

On my part, I can also add that the chief officer in charge of the violent repression of the protests of the high school kids in Pisa this spring is the same person that was in charge of the Diaz massacre in Genoa over 20 years ago.

It's not worth the effort, that's what insurance is for.

I understand that it is upsetting to have your own property stolen, especially if objects with sentimental value are involved, but I would never expect the police to be able to track a stranger that ransacked my house.

Anyway, no excuse for the lack of compassion shown from the comments they made, I can imagine the same person telling a rape victim that if she was ugly it wouldn't happen."

ld1osyg,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"We spent 6 weeks in '22 there during peak season. We travelled all over from Naples to the Dolomites. 
We stayed near the train station in Rome and did all the usual tourist things all over Italy. We had 0 issues ANYWHERE. 

The only thing we had was an African man next to the Colosseum, come over to me and shook my hands, and spoke to me in perfect English with an Australian accent (we are from there). He asked me where I was from, and he replied that he come from a small town also in Australia this was a town, only Aussies would know. I struck up small talk, and then he pulled me close and asked me for money in an African style accent. 

He has obviously listened and learnt to mimic accents and research or listen to where people are from while around all the tourists.. I was actually impressed. If I had some, I would have given him some Euros just out of pure dedication."
ld18ql3,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I live in Italy and none of that has happened to me, but I don't mind people venting about it when it does.  I can see how it would be stressful"
ld1tqj3,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I know bad things can happen but I've spent a lot of time in Italy over the years and not experienced anything bad.  We bought a house here in 2017, prior to that, my wife and I had travelled to Italy at least 20 times.  Since we bought, we spend about 4 months a year in Italy.  And in all those visits we've had nothing negative (knock on wood) happen.  The only negative was in 1984 I was in Rome with a French plated BMW 320.  Someone broke into the trunk but there was nothing in the car.  

That said, I don't leave anything visible in a car when parked and avoid leaving anything in a car if it is a risky place.  In cities I generally park in garages (which ZTL's make almost a necessity).  I never carry my passport (I have a copy of the key page in my bag) and am pretty conscious of my belongings in all circumstances (we also spend a lot of time in Manhattan as we have a place there too).  The precautions I take in Italy (primarily in cities - in our town I can leave my front door open with no worry) are the same as I would take in any large city."
ld2ycgk,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,Thank you so effing much for this post!!!  Italy is one of the safest countries in the 1st world and so sick of all these posts about pick pockets and theft which is rife all over the world.  As if Italians have a monopoly on crime when they have one of the lowest crime rates anywhere!

ld1nv65,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Yeah, totally. Travelled quite a lot in Itally. Even Naples wasn't that bad.

ld1tufu,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Spent 3 months this year, sadly I had 1 incident in Napole Centrale, an Indian like guy pinpocketed my gf, after paying at a bar we were waiting for the order at the counter, once we got it, I turn and this guy was really close to me, I didn't realize anything as I thought I bumped him, truth is that he was stealing my gf wallet from her purse. 

Neither she or me saw or felt anything, we both were packed, backpacks, jackets, etc., we realized a couple of minutes later when she observed her purse mid open and her wallet gone. Thankfully, she kept important stuff in an inner pocket and the loss was some euros.

Truth is that they are always there and they are fucking silent."

&#x200B;

Thank you for posting this. There's a small group of posters here who love nothing better than to scare the eff out of people trying to plan their trips to Italy with horror stories. YES: crime exists in Italy as it does the rest of the world. That is counter productive fear mongering and paints a bad picture of an entire country based on 1 or more bad experiences.

In all my years of living in the EU and the US, I was only ever pickpocketed 1ce- by a tiny waif of a girl who grabbed my wallet from inside my zippered up coat in front of Sacre Coeur in the pouring rain. I was more pissed she took the wallet as it had sentimental value: the stuff inside could be replaced.

As with any travel you do anywhere in the world: be aware of your surroundings and keep your sh\*t together. Don't draw attention to yourself either. Leave the shiny stuff at home/hotel/AirBnb if you're scared of being robbed. Then again, you may get robbed in a tourist trap restaurant but if you heed the warning signs you won't be eating at those places anyway. 

Travel- life is too short to spend your time in the same 100 mile radius you grew up in or live in. Rick Steves has it right: travel broadens the mind. You'll have good and bad experiences. I bet Rick got conned more than a few times in his European travels (then again, the 70s and 80s were...different). I'm a dual US/IT citizen who's had a home in IT for decades and yes: they still try to pull fast ones on me in my local town. It's funny to watch them even try. I've stopped numerous bait and switch or scam tactics when the market sellers try to con tourists- I've made some great friends that way (the tourists not the market sellers of course). 

Understand that their culture is ""different"" and not everyone is 100% honest. Sorry but that's a fact. Italians can be many negative things but a country of thieves and robbers they are not."
ld2vd40,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,We spent 3 weeks and had the same experience as you. Other than the pizza.
ld30nm6,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,What was your itinerary??
ld33k9w,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I was there for a week. Nothing happened… was there some questionable and potential prostitution going on outside of the Turkish restaurant.. maybe! But I had a great time.

I saw only 1 homeless guy & he had on nice clothes.

Glad you had a good trip!"
ld34v4s,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,You didn’t experience and volcanic eruptions either? Lame.
ld35e89,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,I was in Italy for 12 days several weeks ago. Nothing happened either. From Venice to Versona to  Dolomites to Rome. But thank you to this sub to tell me about the scams. Safe travels all.
ld3uh76,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"The only bad thing happened so far in 3 weeks was yesterday. On the ferry between Sicily I had to drive to the upper plaform and while I did it the car ahead of me was stopped. My clutch didn’t like to start the car on the steep ramp…
But overall nothing outstanding bad happened here. First time driving here and even Sicily was fine. My drivers license is only 2.5 years old, so far I feel like a hero. (but its still a long way to get back to Hungary, I hope nothing bad will happen in the last 1800km)"
ld3vmik,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I spend around three months a year and the only bad thing that happened to me once what I got an infected ear. I am so sorry that so many people get robbed and I wish you would never happen but then take precautions. My dad does this really silly thing but it’s not stupid I guess.

He put on a shorts with pockets under his pants, puta his wallet and phone and then put his pants over l. He sometimes also has this thing you attach that goes around you but everything is in the front in a little pocket so if you wanna steal that you have to rip it off him and open it, which is rather difficult.

That said some cities are more thieves than others and I stay mostly one month enroll every time I’m there and I guess I might or maybe I’ll look very scary 6 foot two tall guy who is 215 pounds with a big red beard I don’t know if that matters at all. I just look like a generic dude from Ireland."
ld42en8,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,Glad to hear! What did you visit?
ld43zr1,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Same with me during my 2 week trip. I might just head back in the future to make sure it wasn’t beginners luck.

NB, I did see pickpockets operating on the Metro in Rome. Luckily the old man didn’t have anything on him but it was a strange interaction (guy blocking an old man from coming on board) and I only figured it out at the end when the pickpockets jumped off the train at the last second. It was very inconspicuous and looked liked 3 people just trying to get off/on at the same time, but after 5-10 seconds of it, it was very obvious the pickpockets were just stalling."
ld44whi,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,Damm...this sub is wierd...im going to spend the  same time in Lombardia and emialia-romana in september and I was considering blocking this sub. So much doom and gloom. And i already spent similar time in 2019 souther in the country and everything was great

ld4yumt,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,Recently did 2 weeks and the worst we saw was people in front of us leaning their seat back too far on our tour bus
ld58orc,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Unfortunately I had almost the exact same experience.  Spent a month in Catania and nothing.   No robberies, no pickpockets, no anything.    Just great food, wonderful weather and too much damned culture and art etc.  
I couldn’t wait to escape and get back to the craziness of Nicosia, Cyprus. Lol"
ld5c3at,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Same here.. 3 weeks with 5 people, we sat in all the trains, went to all of the most “touristy” places, sat on metros, etc,.. People act like pickpocketing is just isolated to Italy, it happens everywhere and anywhere and if you are aware of your surroundings then you won’t be a victim (speaking on my end)."
ld6395h,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I went to Sisley along Via Toledo in Naples last night and the woman working there ‘accidentally’ and aggressively grabbed the cardigan I was looking at, hitting my face with it after I put it back in the pile and not folding it the exact way it was before. She was also staring at me for 5 minutes straight while I was looking around at clothes on hangers with my hands, as one does when they go clothes shopping. Never going back there…

But that was the only negative experience I had after spending 10 days across Naples and Sorrento."
ld6twah,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I’ve lived here five years total, in three different places, and nothing of the sort has ever happened to me. This sub can be helpful but also paranoid."
ld7g81s,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Just returned from Rome. A little strike action on the Metro but that happens in London too. Otherwise a great trip. No scams, no pulls, no traps. Just good food and pleasant people."
ld7o9px,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"100%. Just home from 18 days of amazing times and zero trauma. Rome was incredible, easy to  navigate and no pickpockets or other bullshit. Sorrento and Amalfi were blissful. Umbria and Tuscany were explored by car in the most pleasant way. People were genuine and friendly. 

I am reminded that bad situations are the extreme and more rare than reported."
ld89gmk,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Last summer a college student (presumably studying abroad) got her purse stolen along with credit cards and passport. We were on the train together and she was on the phone saying her social security #, d.o.b, and other personal information. 

I didn’t get my stuff stolen last summer!"
ld8d3ta,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Same, just came back like 3days ago from a 10day trip in Italy (Milan, Florence and Rome) and nothing happened. Not like we were waiting for it to happen but we were expecting for the worst. We were so cautious with our movements that we seemed paranoid sometimes but i guess u just really have to be aware with ur surroundings and you will be fine. Same thing goes with Paris, you see the scams and all that but just ignore it and they actually will leave u alone."
ld8pet0,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"How do people get their passports stolen? Are they just left sitting in an open purse? I’m so confused. I’m genuinely asking because we have a trip coming up and with all these posts of stolen passports, I’m wondering if I’d do something they did."
ld9aauo,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,My closest call so far was I was walking in Palermo and I walked past a guy that gave me a weird vibe then half a block later when I was glancing at a shop I felt a tug on my back pack and saw the guy in the reflection with his hand on my bag. I stopped short and he bumped into me. I looked at my backpack and the top compartment that’s for things like sun glasses was mostly open. I yelled pick pocket and he rushed off. I wanted to kick him but it would have been into traffic. Only other thing is offered to buy drugs at one specific set of stairs twice so I don’t go down them anymore in the evening.
ldae6fh,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Amalfi has been fantastic, Naples as well. No stress good vibes"
ldbr2p2,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Nothing scary happened to me, but I experienced a lot of racism and ignorant comments when I was there for 3 weeks."
ldco3jo,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,Same here! Although I was very concerned I would be pickpocketed or luggage stolen. The only thing happened to me is that I was short-changed in the bar/shop but I made a little scandal:D
ldlctt7,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I was terrified before we left for Puglia that my rental was gonna get stolen and be in Albania before I even noticed. Then the rental car company hooked us up with a Mercedes cause nothing was left. I knew it was gone then. 

Nothing happened. 2 weeks driving around. Hitting random beaches and sites. Nothing. 

Tourism is just like yelp reviews. People mostly share the bad stories."
ldnrxih,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I’ve travelled to Italy three times and each trip was better than the previous. The warmth of the people, the architecture and the food, my gawd, the food! is the best I’ve ever had. Nothing like it."
ldqxmvh,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Theft only happens to very distracted people and in big cities. I see it happening in Rome, Barcelona (Barcelona is quite dangerous compared to Madrid), etc. I would only be careful in Barcelona, gipsy kids in Athens' downtown and they're a serious threat, bad neighborhoods in Paris and London, and the 3 days I stayed in Rome it did seem that has theft potential, Budapest is dangerous for theft and fraud. For the rest of Europe, it's 100% safe. Tuscany, Italy is 100% safe and beautiful. The rest of Europe is very safe."

ld1c7a4,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,I have been traveling every year to Italy for a total over 6 months.  Nothing bad happened to me.  I enjoy Italy.

ld1ewnh,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Good to know the terrible pizza still exists, I was in Naples for a while back in 03-05, sure they may have started the idea but it's been made way better since."
ld23x7n,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I went there as a kid and got propositioned by a grey haired man in his car by the beach while I was alone at night. It’s a shame you couldn’t have that same experience. It’s a real confidence booster, if nothing else."
ld1gx4h,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"Cool story.

I did two weeks in Italy last year, nothing happened. 

I did two weeks in Italy this year, something happened. I got robbed for the first time while traveling.  I've traveled to every continent and am fairly weary of my surroundings.

Both trips were amazing and unforgettable. I will return to Italy again next year.

Don't downplay that parts of Italy have a serious crime problem that target tourists."

ld1kg6h,t3_1e2ijur,1e2ijur,"I feel like this stuff happens where there’s a lot of migrants. Venice was flooded with migrants when I was there recently.  I encountered a few that were selling roses.

One guy came up to us after we took a group picture and said “ im done for the night, take roses.” And he insisted bc we said no at first, then when we begrudgingly took, he said “just a little bit of money, just a little”. Then we just gave them back. 

Other than some rose sellers, no pickpocket issues.

There was graffiti on some buildings and trash on the ground in Venice, too. But the islands of Burano and Murano were sqeaky clean and no issues.

Also Sorrento and Capri were perfectly fine as well."

I did see a lady while walking into a restaurant myself, taking selfies at a table in a restaurant across the street, that musta got her phone or her purse stolen from the table since she was talking to the cops later when we left the restaurant and she looked distressed"

ld4xho9,t1_ld1osyg,1e2ijur,Yeah this is exactly us lol. except the guy was on the bridge on the way to Castel Sant’Angelo. He kept asking me about my shoes and where I got them etc. I knew he was full of shit because I was wearing ratty hiking boots I had worn for a couple months in Europe + tons of hikes and they looked like shit haha. Just kept walking but that was literally the only time I was approached.
ld5lmi1,t1_ld1osyg,1e2ijur,"We saw a lot of these guys in Rome. My favorite was when one of them gave me a bracelet, saying, ""it's a free gift"" and I just leaned in, smiled, handed it back to him and replied, ""there's no such thing."" He smiled back and left me alone after that."
ld4rdpy,t1_ld1osyg,1e2ijur,"Had this happen to my wife and MIL at the Colosseum as well. Only issue we had in our week long trip. Was kinda funny from then on to overhear a couple other men saying they were from ""Senegal"" at the other places we stopped"

ld1bi3d,t1_ld18ql3,1e2ijur,I understand that happens and I understand people need to get it off their chest.  Maybe there should be an “I need to vent” flair/tag on here?  lol idk.
ld50xwz,t1_ld2ycgk,1e2ijur,Thank you! unfortunately some (loud) italians are just used to talk down on their own country under every aspect. And yeah we have one of the lowest murder rate in the world with 300 for a 60 million people country (!) and we are behind or at max on the same level with other major countries in Europe such as France and germany for robberies and other crimes.
ld3wl2c,t1_ld1iymc,1e2ijur,"If you ever go to Rome, I can tell you that there’s one pizza place and I’ve been to so many being there several months out of the year. But there was one place that made this Neapolitan pizza, a diavola . Pizza Ciro close to the Apple Store downtown via del corso . If you get to that one just type in what I wrote if you’re ever interested it’s like a 10 minute walk and if you look at the recommendations and the reviews, it’s mostly done by Italians so that’s another reason you know that it’s good."
ld30v3r,t1_ld1iymc,1e2ijur,It was some cafe in Riomaggiore.  The best way I can describe it is “bad middle school cafeteria pizza.”
ld3uz2g,t1_ld28t0u,1e2ijur,"That's true, the art of pickpocketing is doing the job unnoticed."
ld1dr8v,t1_ld19p9h,1e2ijur,I’m interested in how people get their passport stolen if they leave it in the  hotel room safe or wear it in their money belt?
ld1b7ux,t1_ld19p9h,1e2ijur,"I’m glad you had a good trip. I’m also genuinely sorry your friend had her stuff stolen.  I know that happens too.  There just seems to be have been so many posts here lately detailing all the unfortunate things people have experienced, that I wanted to point out that there are way more trips where everything is fine.  

For the record I did lose my credit card (lost, not stolen), with half my trip to go and everything was fine."
ld2dkc5,t1_ld1nv65,1e2ijur,"After a number of trips to Italy, I learned early on to not go by Google restaurant ratings. I know many are against Airbnb but my hosts have not steered me wrong with recommendations for restaurants they frequent when out to eat. And/or I seek out establishments off the beaten paths. I regularly think of this Anthony Bourdain quote: “I’m a big believer in winging it. I’m a big believer that you’re never going to find perfect city travel experience or the perfect meal without a constant willingness to experience a bad one. Letting the happy accident happen is what a lot of vacation itineraries miss.”"
ld81l4s,t1_ld1tufu,1e2ijur,Napels is barely Italy

Of course they can. It isn’t 90% of visitors who do so safely, it is likely closer to .001% who experience a problem and most of those issue come from carelessness. Wear a money belt. Keep your belongings in sight, connected to you or connected to something unmovable on the train. Don’t put your phone in your back pocket. Don't set it on the table. Assume anyone who is distracting you is doing so with a less than helpful purpose behind it.. Again, if you live in any big city in the world, these are things you practice every day. The great thing about Italy is that you are far less likely to have anybody who is trying to take something from you carrying a gun than in America.."

Sorrento and Capri are touristy but not at the level of venice. They didn’t have a migrant problem and didn’t  have any pickpocket issues. Keep thinking there’s no correlation.  France gets migrants and an uptick in terrorist attacks.  Oh gee, can’t be because of migrants!


“The latest data from the Department of Public Security of the Ministry of the Interior, reprocessed by the “Sole24Ore,” tell that in the first six months of 2021, foreigners in Italy committed 59% of petty thefts, 54% of thefts in commercial establishments and 52% of robberies in public streets. For sexual assault we are at 39%, for drug offenses 36%, for threats or beatings 25%. Foreigners then accounted for 20 percent of voluntary and negligent homicides, fraud and money laundering.”
