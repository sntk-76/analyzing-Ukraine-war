ItalyTravel,"I loved how packed it was, I loved whenever it rained, I loved getting stared at everywhere (Im pasty af, muscular, with a big droopy mustache and really long, thick hair, so this happened A LOT), I loved dealing with the metro being out of service so I could walk around where id never been, I loved the metro being in service so I could be magically transported anywhere in the city I needed to. My city has no reliable metro, so people have to drive everywhere. On that, the drivers in both Rome and Florence were amazing, I didnt see a single accident the entire trip and they're all driving down old ass cobblestone roads with no line markings flawlessly. Meanwhile, my city has massive highways, clearly marked and posted everywhere, and I am actually petrified whenever I need to get on it from how absolutely awful the drivers are, I see an accident or the remnants of one every time I go out.

 The food everywhere was perfect, tourist trap or no give me that bottle of red pepper oil and im set with anything. I completely ignored any food plans I made because my first night I had amatriciana and had it at like three other places after that, the thick spaghetti blew my mind. Oxtail was amazing, the speed at which some of these places get your food out is also amazing. I sit down outside, have a cig (which I dont normally smoke but they were SO CHEAP in italy compared to home), and before its done I already have my wine at my table and my food is no more than 5 minutes behind. Eat it, get check (everything had a very good price considering it was actual italian. ""authentic"" where I am would be at least $50 a plate not including drinks, in Rome it was closer to 20-30 euro for all). Stuff I normally wouldn't have picked, like funghi porcini alla piastra con porri gratinati, was immaculate and incredibly fresh. Its nice not having tip stuff shoved in your face at every corner, I dont mind tipping in the US and did it a few times in Italy when I was really catered to or assisted well by the waiter and/or host, but no bs with like thirteen separate screens starting you at like a 20% gratuity for some awful food and subpar service. 

I am 25 and everyone who was in the mood to meet someone was very out going, and there were no ""bad characters"" just looking for a fight for the sake of a fight like in the US (i stayed in castro by termini so I thought id see a lot of that, but none). maybe its just where I go in my city back home but in America everyone has their little ""cliques"", you come up to a group as a stranger and its like trying to take a seat at the popular kids table in high school, despite everyone being in their mid to late 20s they act like stuck up teenagers. Meanwhile, there wasnt anyone in Rome or Florence who wouldnt give me the time of day, whether for a quick question or a long conversation, literally everyone from everywhere at my hostel EXCEPT other Americans. 

I miss the history, there's just a millennial old story around every corner, I have a list of major monuments I still missed despite being in Rome for a few weeks, and my day and a half in Florence didnt cover nearly enough there. My first full day in Rome i left my hostel at 5 am and just wondered towards the vatican and it was so deserted, then suddenly I round a corner and thousands of people just appear and the city is awake.  

The construction was so unintrusive I cant believe anyone even mentioned it, but then again I have to drive everywhere back home so any construction makes my commute that much longer. If one path is blocked, theres only about a dozen other back alleys or cobblestone streets that take a minute to get to that lead directly to where you wanted to go anyways.

when it rained it was sunny, I wont see a fully cloud free day where I live for literal months this winter. 

Even the homeless were pleasant, they mainly just slept and chilled, never bothered with anyone. I felt 100x more safe around Roma Termini at 3 am as a foreigner than I did anywhere in my home city at any point past sundown and that is as sincere as I can be (then again, with the amount of people to pick from I am not one of the more wise targets to choose, although that doesnt apply in my home city because Americans are nuts when it comes to violent reprisal). The people hustling goods were easy enough to say no to, and a lot of times they had useful stuff I needed (thank you umbrella man at castro metro stop). My friend went to venice beach in LA a few years ago, and let me tell you it was basically the exact opposite experience I had with any ""ne'er-do-well"" in Rome or Florence, he basically got threatened by a gang of homeless as soon as they saw money in a wallet he took out to buy some food from a shop, and in the US the possibility of someone packing a fire arm is so much higher you simply cannot fuck around when someone threatens you.    

I know I had a fully tourist experience, but even the really awful stuff was thrilling because it made me feel self reliant, self confidant, and just like a man. I havent felt like a real person in so long, theres so little for me around where I am. I could live in Rome or Florence in squalor, in complete isolation, in between an ongoing construction site and a busted down metro station, and I would still be more satisfied and whole than I am just being in my big house in my home city. Coming back with Covid and having to isolate totally for a week left me with so much disdain for my city, and the absolute rudeness and spitefulness of everyone working at that hell hole in queens known as JFK international compared to how friendly everyone was in every institution I went to in Italy (including FCO in Rome) filled me with a newfound resentment for the self-importance and ""better than everywhere else"" attitude that drips from American institutions like that and the people.  

Maybe everyone feels like this after seeing the Eternal city, maybe I just need to get out more where I am. But idk, I really want to come back and try living for a bit, like actual living like I do here. Get up, work, gym, cook my own dinner then go to bed, using whatever free time I have to explore and meet the natives and other immigrants like myself. Even with the loads of newfound free time I have in my home city I just dont have a thing to do that interests me. In Italy, closing my eyes for even a second meant missing something I'd regret. I miss it very much and am desperate to return ASAP. ",t2_16j0pv1qo1,There isnt a thing I dont miss about italy,0.95,1024,1730754985.0,1730754985.0,254,KarlVanLoon,1gjpikt
ItalyTravel,"I’m ending my two weeks in Italy with my family of five. Mostly in Tuscany, but 2.5 days in Rome. My 5 year old son is obsessed with law enforcement and military and has gone up to literally every man/woman in uniform that he’s seen. EVERY single one, from the military police, soldiers, local police, etc have been so incredibly kind and happy to have my son engage with them. Many LEO’s in the states carry around stickers that they give to kids, so my son has asked them all if they have stickers…something that’s hilariously confused all of the Italians. Today, after I explained to an officer what he meant, he immediately ripped off his “Reparto Mobile” patch from his arm and handed it so my son . I thought he was just giving it to my son to check out, but he insisted he take it. It made my sons day and he went around to every other officer showing off his patch.

I was so disappointed by missing out on the quintessential Italian experience that I doubt I’ll ever go back.

I just don’t think I can handle the stress that comes with all the uneventfulness of the mundane days.

Sure the art was amazing, the geography gorgeous, and I met a wonderful fellow solo traveler, and I did have the worst pizza of my life.  But I just don’t think I can bear that kind of harrowing experience again.

ItalyTravel,"I’m a born and raised New Yorker who just went to Italy for the first time ever! (10 days, ROME > VENICE > FLORENCE > ROME). I did a lot of doom scrolling and panic reading on here which got myself very worked up and anxious for a trip that ultimately ended up having nothing bad happen lol here’s some things I wish I read on here to prepare myself better.

1. Almost EVERYTHING is under construction right now (and will be until the end of the year) because the Catholic Jubilee is next year. This means beloved churches and landmarks covered by scaffolding, fountains not running etc. Luckily the Trevi is already done with restoration but pretty much everything else was covered. Wish someone told me that as I might have chose to go somewhere else this year! Still plenty of beautiful things but the scaffolding (both indoors and out) was distracting and ruined a lot of photos.

2. There’s free water everywhere in Rome (except restaurants)! I don’t know why everyone complains about there being no water in Rome when there’s hundreds of free drinking fountains on nearly every other block. It was very convenient to fill up our water bottles all day and just have those when we went to restaurants (or if we drank it all, we would splurge the couple of euro to drink bottled water lol)

3. The Vatican isn’t as strict as you’d think. Yes, have your shoulders covered but I saw plenty of knees and even midriffs. Always better safe than sorry (I wore ankle length skirt + a scarf over shoulders) but just know you’re not going to be turned away if you’re not dressed like a nun. Some churches you don’t have to be covered at all; really big and popular ones you do but as long as your shoulders/back is covered, you’re fine.

4. Pick pockets really aren’t a thing if you’re self aware about personal space. Obviously if you’re in a huge bustling crowd, put your bag in front of you, but otherwise, you’re fine. I really thought it was going to be the Wild West out there and it ended up just being like any big city.

5. I don’t know why, but all my research said Italians do not wear shorts or short skirts and that if you wear those you will stick out and potentially be harassed. Instead, I saw plenty of locals wearing shorts and short skirts (although it was mid 90s temperature wise). Also, if you’re a person of color like I am, people are going to assume you’re foreign anyway so fuck it and wear what you want. Honestly, the only dead give away (besides being POC-- yes, you can be Italian/European if you're POC, I'm just going off optical assumptions here) is if you’re in athleisure/workout clothes OR a Hawaiian shirt with a fanny pack around your waist and camera around your neck lol.

6. The racism wasn’t bad (at least for me) but I was always with my partner, who is a big tattooed guy so people tend to not fuck with us.

7. The one thing I actually DID read a lot here is you need to PACK LIGHT and NOT BRING ROLLER SUITCASES. We did just two duffle bags and a backpack, did laundry once at the mid way point of our ten day trip and were fine. We were able to move a lot better and blend in by carrying lighter bags in comparison to sooooo many tourists struggling with their roller suitcases over the cobblestone and up a million stairs. We felt so free just breezing on by them.

8. High speed train tickets do NOT need to be validated. I was so worried about getting kicked off the train because I couldn’t figure out how to validate our tickets then it turns out they don’t need to be validated at all. You’re good to go with a digital ticket on your phone!

9. The crowds aren’t unbearable as long as you get up relatively early for your scheduled things then use the rest of the day to chill away from the big attractions. We went to Trevi Fountain around 7:30/45am and while there was a small crowd of people, everyone was pretty polite in giving each other space and time to take their pictures. If you’re from NY, even the crowds later in the day won’t bother you so much BUT like I said, we did all the popular shit in the morning and saved afternoons/evenings for chilling and exploring elsewhere.

10. Go ahead and do the touristy shit!!!! I am all for authentic/off the beaten path experiences abroad BUT it is also important to check the boxes on the classics-- they're classics for a reason. Just do them early AM and it won't drive you crazy. How can you go to Rome and never see the inside of the Colosseum?! Come on, people!!! It was all worth it, even just to do it once and never again. Then the next time you go to Italy you hit up all the small, never heard of towns, blah, blah, blah.

  
Anyway, hope that was helpful to people planning their trip to Italy! We had an absolutely wonderful time and can't wait to go back someday :)",t2_k9viwy9fv,10 Things I Wish I Knew Before My 10 Days in Italy (first time!),0.95,810,1726248313.0,1726248313.0,112,snowbludd,1fg0bhu
ItalyTravel,"Second trip to Italy, went to Rome the first time then Rome, Pisa and Florence the second time.  Obviously everyone talks about how amazing Italy is, but then the same negatives come up time and time again - pickpockets, crowds, scammers, dirty cities, tourist trap restaurants. In both my experiences so far these issues are made out to be way worse than they actually are!*

1. Pickpockets:
The way Italy is talked about online (Rome in particular) would make you think that every single person who walks down the street will get pickpocketed every time they leave the house. Maybe I'm just a savvier traveller than I thought but on both of my trips I absolutely never felt at risk ever. I carried a cross body bag (not an anti-theft one, with no clips on the zippers or anything) and encountered absolutely no problems. In busier areas like train stations, near the Trevi or Spanish steps and on the metro I kept my hand holding the top of my bag, and that was pretty much the only precaution I took and was fine. I get that pickpocketing will happen to some people, even those taking precautions, but generally you will be fine as long as you keep a hand on your bag in busy places and don't have your wallet sticking out your back pocket or top of your bag.






2. Crowds:
Yes, the cities are busy, but again the way people talk about it makes it sound like you can not move around anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the centre without being in a swarm of people. In reality, the big sites will be busy if you visit at peak times, as well as the main streets leading to them, but you are never further than about a three minute walk from a quiet side street. Everyone says how Florence is overrun with crowds - we felt it was a lot less busy than we expected even around the main sites, apart from perhaps the Ponte Vecchio where the nature of it being a bridge means a high volume of people are concentrated in a small place. 

We had a mix of some things booked in advance - colosseum, Vatican museums, borghese gallery, bell tower climb, accademia and Uffizi - and then others we just turned up for when we had spare time/couldn't book in advance - castel st'angelo, pantheon, st Peters basilica, baths of caracalla, the duomo complex in Florence, the leaning tower climb in Pisa. The vatican museums were probably the one place that felt too busy, but you can't blame other people for wanting to see the same things you want to, but I chose not to visit again on my second trip. The longest we waited in line for was probably 30 minutes for St Peters basilica at about 9am. The Trevi fountain and Spanish steps were perfectly quiet at 9am - other people around, but easily able to get a photo with nobody else in it. No need to get up at 5am like you see suggested on TikTok (although a sunrise walk around Rome would be gorgeous, so I'd recommend it for that reason alone)


3. Scammers:
Yes, in busy places people might try and sell you bracelets or give you roses. Nobody was all that pushy - generally anytime I said 'no grazie' it was politely met with 'prego' and they moved on. There were the odd ones who were a little pushier but a firmer no or just ignoring worked fine. Nobody tried to put anything on my wrist or forced a rose on me.


4. Dirty cities:
I guess this one is mainly about Rome, but you hear everyone say how dirty it is. I did not find this at all. I walked past maybe two bins that were overflowing (that happens here in the UK too) and one bin that had a couple of bags piled next to it. Maybe I just happened to visit at a particularly clean time, but I really don't understand where the idea of Rome being a dirty city comes from. 


5. Tourist trap restaurants: 
It feels like everyone is constantly searching for the best hidden gem, non tourist trap, local resident only restaurants. We generally steered clear of restaurants really close to main attractions but we weren't relentlessly pursuing finding the best, most authentic restaurant. We just looked for somewhere that we liked the look of, had space without needing a reservation but wasn't empty and wasn't obscenely expensive. We didn't eat anywhere with pictures on the menu, but we did find that pretty much every restaurant had an English translation (I know that's something often told to avoid). We quite possibly ate at places that might be considered a tourist trap by people who live there, but we did not eat a bad meal anywhere, and we generally thought the food and drinks were very good value. Maybe the food is just particularly bad in the UK where we are from and we had low expectations but we thoroughly enjoyed every meal.

On a related note, everyone says Pisa is nothing but the tower and completely overrated. We went only because it made sense logistically and the festival being on in Lucca meant we couldn't stay there instead. We were only there for a day, but were really pleasantly surprised. The tower is absolutely worth seeing and climbing it was really fun, the square where the tower is is lovely, the town itself was nice to just wander around, and walking the walls was a great way to see the city and an unexpected highlight of the trip. It made a nice change of pace from Florence and Rome and we were really glad we stayed there for a night! 

I just wanted to write this post because I see the same things over and over and as with all things on the internet it feels like those who have bad experiences are more likely to share than those who had good experiences or completely fine experiences.


*I'm writing this from the perspective of a visiting tourist and what these things were like and how they impacted the tourist experience. Obviously crowds and over tourism are a problem for people who live in these cities and I'm not trying to say that they aren't, but that's not a perspective I can comment on.

ItalyTravel,"Just completed a 1.5 weeks trip in Milan, Florence, Pisa and Rome and came back to US. I’m still in shock and speechless mode, after seeing so many stunning world class artworks and cannot calm myself down.

Both me and my friend are feeling hopeless now because we don’t know where to go next. There’s no other places existing on the earth that can give you such an experience to see so much Bernini, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Raffaello, Botticelli than Italy. I don’t remember how many times we have lost our words when standing in front of those artworks, just simply countless times.

We are clearly lost on where to go next and the only places we can think of would be Egypt and China, but no one, I repeat, no one can do paintings and sculptures as a nation compared to Italy.

Thank you all the Italians who created this land and raised these most talented artists in human history so we now have the opportunity to see their works. 

Edit: thanks all for your generous comments.

I have personally been to many beautiful museums in my life, like the British Museum, the Louvre, the Orsay Museum. I live in NYC so I had the privilege of being a NY state resident to visit the Metropolitan Museum as many times as I want for pretty much free. But I do feel that Italy sets the standard of arts for the whole human race when engaging such on a whole country level.

In my last 1.5 weeks journey, I was with my friend in:

Milan
1. Visited the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana and saw Raphael’s “The School of Athens Cartoon” and a lot of Da Vinci’s 
2. Visited the Santa Maria delle Grazie to see “The Last Supper”
3. Visited the Castello Sforzesco to see Michelangelo’s last masterpiece “Rondanini Pieta”
4. Of course, the grand and magnificent Duomo di Milano

Florence
1. Visited the Uffizi Gallery to see Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus”and “Primavera”, Michelangelo’s “Tondo Doni”, Raphael’s “Self Portrait”, Da Vinci’s “Annunciation” and so much more.
2. Visited the Accademia Gallery to see the great David statue and a lot of other sculptures by Michelangelo
3. Visited the Pitti Palace to see Raphael’s Room
4. Visited the Casa Buonarroti to see a lot of sculptures by Michelangelo
5. Visited Cappelle Medicee, where Michelangelo’s sculptures of “Day”, “Night”, “Dawn” and “Dusk” were sitting
6. Visited the Basilica of Santa Croce, where the great Michelangelo and Galileo are sleeping in, with a great fortune to see the ""Last Supper"" fresco by Taddeo Gaddi
7. Needless to say, the fascinating Duomo di Firenze and its museum - inside the museum we did not expect but saw Michelangelo’s “Pieta” after turning around a corner and was totally frozen standing at the first glance of it

Rome
1. Visited most of the landmarks of Rome e.g. the Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum, Market of Trajan, the Holy Stairs, countless basilicas and so much more.

Vatican City
1. Saw just stunning sculptures e.g. Laocoon Group
2. Saw Raphael’s “The School of Athens” and so much more.
3. Saw Sistine Chapel needless to say.
4. Michelangelo’s “Pieta” was covered for maintenance for Jubilee next year so we were not able to see it, but I was in the St. Peter’s basilica 2 years ago so I know the shocking feeling of seeing it for sure. 

Above is just a limited part of what we saw and it’s just me and my friend feeling that, it’s not just those fantastic artworks, but also long survived architectures which are engraved with the blood and souls of the culture of Italy. Look at those mind blowing basilicas, look at the ruins of palaces of the Roman Empire, and we almost walked around the Colosseum every night after dinner just to feel the atmosphere of history.

Yeah we may say Egypt is also great but the Renaissance Revolution has inspired and created a civilization that is much closer to our real life nowadays than those ancient, mysterious and a little hard to understand Egyptian cultures from thousands years ago, which you can see people’s lives and their beliefs in their religions through the expression of the artworks in human shapes (compared to the aliens looking Egyptian Gods) by the artists.

Me and my friend just became speechless on our way to FCO airport where we departed and we were kept silent just because we didn’t know what to say, after having so much into our heads. We definitely feel that those artworks have powers and lives in themselves which human languages cannot explain. 

We both agreed that it is not easy at all to see these many artworks and architectures in a short 1.5 weeks visit, and we are really trying our best to digest and absorb as much as we can but, again, I really can’t imagine anywhere else can again, be a competitive rival, against Italy’s culture in any ways.

We covered cinque terre, Florence, Tuscany, Venice and Dolomites.

The trip went pretty well.
Fell in love with cinque terre and Florence.
Dolomites was BEAUTIFUL. Beyond beautiful.

Everything was going extremely well until the second last day of our trip. We were coming back from Venice to Milan by train.

My husbands camera and 2 lenses got stolen from his camera bag which was kept right above us from Vicenza station.
The guy was sitting behind us stole and left swiftly.
Luckily my husband checked his bag and ran out and told the ticket checker.
Unfortunately the train doors had to be shut and the guy ran away.

The ticket checker immediately called the police at the station and told them about the situation and he left us hanging after saying “THIS IS ITALY” ….
We were numb and shattered.

After sometime I see the ticket checker come back and told us that the police have caught the guy and asked us to rush to the police station.
We were relieved.
The thief’s backpack had lots of cameras, lenses,
Laptop, iPhones and AirPods.

We were relived to see our stuff there. We claimed it back and finished the formalities at the police station.

Grateful that we got our stuff back but feeling very sad for the people whose belongings got stolen.

ItalyTravel,"It pains me to write this. I adore Italy, it's more home than home to me HOWEVER I wouldn't want any other woman to relive my experience.

I arrived in Verona from Milano. I adored the town as soon as I arrived and the people are lovely. As with all towns I visit in Italy I wandered around the centre at night. On my way back a drunk man pulled up beside me and tried to get me to get in his car. Luckily three other people were making their way home and made sure I safely got back to my apartment. I didn't want to let the minor situation deter me. It's summer, people get drunk. The following day I walked back to the town centre following busy roads in broad daylight. By the third pedestrian stop I was sure I was being followed. A man in his car pulled up beside me whenever he had the opportunity --- same registration number. I was sure I was being followed, he literally slowly drove up to me. I got to the town centre, shaken up. Headed back to my apartment. Fast forward to the night, of course I told myself there could be a logical explanation... I had tickets to a concert. Walked back, enjoyed the show and followed busy streets but it was late and the last stretch was empty. A car sped past me as they do --- only it turned back and headed straight for me pulling up where I had to pass. I knew I had to run, my apartment was about 400m from the car. I contacted the host to ask her if this was something she's had happen. She assured me she hasn't. Told me that from my paper work she can see I'm an attractive woman. I shouldn't walk alone, shouldn't walk alone at night and should carry pepper spray or some deterrent.

I told her I could no longer stay there and disclosed I have a history of both sexual assault and an obsessive stalker. I trust my instincts and that I'm not safe. I was told I shouldn't travel in my psychological state.

I find this interaction to be borderline blaming me for what was happening. I travel solo because I won't let men who terrorized me control my life. I left Verona, shows and day trips I booked and the accomodation paid in full is a lesser loss than placing myself in danger.

If you're traveling to Verona in a group or as a couple, you're likely safe because you won't stand out as much but if not be cautious and alert. I'd rather share this than have another woman become a statistic.

ItalyTravel,"I loved it. That's it. Ok, not really. Just thought I would share my thoughts/opinions on the cities, attractions, etc.

Our itinerary was tight for a first-time trip with two kids (17 and 8), but we wanted to see as much as we could in two weeks. 

**Milan (1 night):**  
We flew into Milan from Austin, TX because it was cheaper to do so. That was really our only reason. That being said, the Duomo Milano was one of our favorite places to visit (ranked 8.0 out of 10...more on this in a second). It was a stunningly beautiful place and we even went up on the terraces. My daughter (8) ranked it VERY low because of the stairs. Keep this in mind if you have any health issues or bad knees. It was NOT a fun walk to the top, especially for an 8 year old. That being said, it was way easier than the Duomo Firenze. Yikes. Galleria Vittorio Emmanuel is nice but overrated. No reason not to visit it though if you are already at the Duomo. You can take some nice photos there.

**Venice (3 nights):**  
We spent three nights in Venice and all I have to say is ""MAGICAL"". I don't get why anyone (saw it all over Reddit, social, tiktok, etc) that Venice is overrated. For this small-town hick boy, it was great. One of the highlights of our trip was just walking around Venice. Truly amazing. St. Mark's Basilica was amazing. Doge Palace pretty cool. ***Hot opinion: the gondola ride was REALLY overrated, but, I guess you have to do it when you are in Venice right?*** Not sure why I felt this way, but just thought it was ""meh"". We also spent half a day at Lido Beach. It was a great way to rest a little and get some sun. Not a bad beach but beware, most of it is ""private"" meaning you have to pay for a spot. They classify families as two adults and one child. So with us, we had to pay for another whole spot (for two people) for our 17 year old. We declined and went to the free beach. Again, it was fine. We bought the 3-day pass for the water buses and used it enough, but probably not enough to justify the cost. It did help going to Lido, Murano, and to the train station. Speaking of Murano, there was one glass factory [(Wave Murano Glass Factory)](https://wavemuranoglass.com/en/) that had FREE ""tour"". Really you could go into their shop and watch them work. Definitely a cool little surprise after we thought we missed out on going on a tour. 

***\*\*The ranking system\*\*\* - I thought it would be interesting to ask everyone their ranking of things we did, places we stayed, food we ate, etc. Scale of 1-10. I will share more of those later.***

**Florence (3 nights):**  
I was looking forward to Florence before we got there because our friends absolutely LOVE it. They have spent several days in Florence separate times just to enjoy the museums, etc. I on the other hand had Florence as our ""least favorite stop"". Don't get me wrong, it is great, but it was SEVERELY crowded. For a place that seems small (I know it is a large city) it had wayyyyyy too many people. We knew that going in that Italy is always busy during the summer, but for some reason, Florence just seemed over the top! That being said, we still had a great time visiting the Accademia and Uffizi galleries and the Vecchio Bridge. We spent one morning driving to Pisa to see the Tower and we also had a nice time in Lucca eating lunch and doing a little shopping. **Driving in Italy wasn't too bad, but, I am pretty sure Google Maps had NO idea which roads were one-way and not one-way. Be aware if you plan on driving.** The first few minutes in the rental car were insane. I defintely turned down one one-way street but luckily no one was coming. :) The Duomo if Florence was a GREAT view of the city, but my gosh, THE STAIRS. This is another one that if you have any kind of issues you may want to avoid it. It was rough and I am not in that bad of shape. If you have small kids I would not make them do it. I swear our 8 year old was the youngest kid I saw up at the top. Probably for good reason. I do hope to give Florence another chance some time in the future!

**Rome (4 nights):**  
Overall, Rome was our favorite place as a family. SO much to see and do and the weather was VERY NICE. The first day we were there it was close to 90 degrees and hot, but some kind of front came through and our last two days were amazing. Highs in the upper 70s I believe and sunny. Was really really nice. We obviously did a lot of the typical touristy things (Vatican, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon) but one of our favorites was Santa Maria Maggiore basilica. WOW. For a place that I was not really aware of (not sure where it ranks on ""must see in Rome"" lists) this place was absolutely gorgeous. If you are near it, visit it. You won't be disappointed. We also went to the Vatican which was hectic and crowded, but we got in fairly easy with our pre-purchased ticket. ***Now, we wanted to see the Sistine Chapel but had NO idea you had to walk a LOOOOONNNGGGG way through the Vatican museum to reach it. Keep that in mind.*** I had not heard that before going. Personally I had the Vatican ranked high because I love historical things. This place was mind-blowing. My daughter was upset we didn't see the Pope, which see swears I promised. hahaha. We also enjoyed the Castel Sant'Angelo. Again, to me, one of the ""didn't know much about"" places. One of the ""hidden gems"" we discovered in Rome was the [Mercato Centrale](https://www.mercatocentrale.com/) at the Termini station. Kind of a very nice food court. We ended up eating there twice while in Rome and once the night before we left in Milan. What a cool place that allows you to find just about anything you want to eat. I recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to visit. The Colosseum was bigger than I thought it was and I wish we did a guided tour. Only reason we didn't is because we couldn't find tickets.

**La Spezia/Cinque Terre (2 nights):**  
Another hidden gem for us was La Spezia. I posted about it on this community earlier. Just a cool city that seems laid back. Our airbnb was right on the main strip through town which made it seem more lively. It was our favorite accommodation of the trip! By far! Cinque Terre was a dream as well. We spent our only real full day at the beach in Monterosso. Much needed time just relaxing and taking in the beauty of the sea. We got there around 9am and it was pretty much empty. We found a place and stayed until about 3pm. We also explored or at least stopped at the other towns along the coast. I would love to go back to this area if we have another chance in the future.

**Milan (1 night):**   
We spent our last half day or so in Milan. The wife and daughter went to see the Last Supper and my son and I went on a tour of San Siro Stadium. We are big soccer fans and it was amazing. Was not aware that their museum not only had AC Milan and Inter stuff, they had things from teams and players who have played at or in San Siro. Pele jersey, Ronaldo, Messi, ANY ONE you can think of. Champions League trophies etc. This was my son's favorite thing we did but I did not rank it since the whole family didn't do it. 

**My family's highest ranked attractions (remember, we have a 8 year old who usually ranked anything with ""long walks"" lower...haha):**  
**1. Exploring Cinque Terre (9.525 average)**  
**2. Santa Maria Maggiore - Rome (9.4)**  
**3. St Mark's Basilica - Venice (9.15)**  
**4. Duomo Milano (9.1)**  
**5. Monterosso Beach day (9.05)**  
**(HM: Doge Palace (8.9); Colosseum (8.75); Vatican (8.675)**

**Biggest Disappointment:** We were unable to get in to see St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Actually, not true. I didn't realize they stopped the line at 6 pm. I walked up to the line and the police officer said ""go in"" and then closed the gate. haha. I was the last person in. Well, the family was in the square taking photos etc and they were not able to get in. I decided I wouldn't make them wait and got out of line. Hmm, probably should have stayed. :/ Also the gondola ride in Venice was ""meh"". 

**Best meal I had:** [Risotteria Melotti Firenze](https://www.risotteriamelottifirenze.it/en/) - Had a rissoto with pepper cream, wild boar ragu, and chives. Holy hell it was perfect. 

**Second best meal I had:** Again in Florence, [Braceria Al'11](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d23977971-Reviews-Braceria_All_11-Florence_Tuscany.html) - GIANT steak that we shared.

ItalyTravel,"Three cities, Rome, Florence, Venice. My wife and my two adult children traveling together. 

What a beautiful country, filled with wonderful people, food, art, architecture. 

Everyone knows that so I’m really going to dispel some of the common travel myths online. 

None of us were targets of pickpockets. We all live or have lived in major US cities. I think the basic street smarts apply. We did all use cross body bags though because we needed to carry stuff walking around all day. 

No one scammed us. We ignored scammers in Rome just like we’d ignore them in New York or Boston. They tried, but they failed fast and moved onto the next target. 

The traffic was not frightening. The cab rides were fun. It was a great way to see the cities, and the cabbies who spoke English were also great tour guides. Yeah, one guy did take us about 10 blocks out of the way, but seriously who cares. Saw more of the city. 

The trains were awesome. Multiple rides within 5 minutes of the posted times. Clean and comfortable. No one stole our bags. 

The August crowds were absolutely mad. So many people everywhere. Getting tickets for things weeks in advance and also getting up early before the crowds surface was key. For example, although we had pre purchased tickets for Vatican museum to get in around 10 am it was already so crowded it was unbearable. Wall to wall tour groups, hard to look at the art. The Sistine chapel was shoulder to shoulder literally, airless and hot. 

On the other hand we had the first morning entry tickets at the Uffizi and we had 90 minutes of practically empty gallery space. 

Advice for an August visit is to pre book as much as you can, be prepared for crowds, and bring your .5L water bottle. It was 95-100F each day we were there. We needed the constant influx of water. 

And finally about all the rules about looking like a tourist and doing things the Italian way. Just chill out. No matter how hard you try or how earnestly you say Ciao they know you’re a tourist. I could tell who was a tourist. Go with it. The friendly people of Italy are happy to help you, to talk through the menu, how to order, what to have when. We found that almost everyone spoke English and that it was used as the common tourist language across all visiting countries.

ItalyTravel,"I recently went on an Italy trip from 7/30 to 8/6, and I'd like to share my experience so it can help future travelers looking for what such a vacation would look like  
  
For some context, we went as a family of four together from the US  
  
Here's a brief overview of what we did on each day  
7/30: Land in Florence  
7/31: Saw Piazza Duomo and surrounding area, see Basilica di San Lorenzo, and Capella dei Principi  
8/1: Saw Piazza Signoria, Ponto Vecchio bridge, Palazzo Pitti & Boboli Gardens, and Galleria Accademia. Train to Rome in the evening  
8/2: Saw the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, and Piazza Navona. Checked out the Vittorio Emmanuelle monument in the evening  
8/3: Guided tours of the Colosseum + Roman Forum, and the Vatican  
8/4: Train to Naples in the morning. Underground tunnel tour, saw Piazza Plebescito and waterfront  
8/5: Day trip to Salerno booking a Lido. Stopped by Amalfi on the way back  
8/6: Flight back

Here's the rough overall cost for our trip  
Flights: $4000  
Hotels: $1750  
Food: $1000  
Tours/Attractions: $1500  
Transportation: $500

Total: about $9000

Ok, so here's my thoughts on the overall trip

Yes, we did go during peak season. However, I honestly don't think it was that bad. The heat was pretty tough on a few days, but if you're in the city - typically you'll have a ton of shade because the buildings are high and the streets narrow. What we would do to avoid the worst of it was to take a break between around 2 and 6 PM most days and return to our hotel during that time. This allowed us to avoid both the crowds and the heat. Obviously, there were some days where this wasn't possible, but for the most part I don't feel like our trip was overrun with tourists.   
  
Booking in advance is massive. We did this whenever possible, and it really saved us a lot of time.   
If you have the additional money, I would highly recommend tours for a lot of the bigger attractions - as you learn so much more about the place itself. The tours for the Colosseum and Vatican were incredibly informative. Plus, in some cases, being in a tour meant you get to skip the line or take a shortcut.   
  
My family is vegetarian, so the food did get a little bit limiting at times. Most restaurants will have at least a few vegetarian options, but after a while the constant diet of either pizza or one of a few select pastas gets a bit old after a while. I did really enjoy the vast majority of the food, however, I think I'm going to need a couple months break from any kind of pasta or pizza. I'm pretty happy I got to try out some famous places though, like All'Antico Vinaio, Osteria da Fortunada, Gino e Toto Sorbillo, and even a two Michelin-starred restaurant. 

The trains are a super convenient way to get around. Both the Florence-Rome and Rome-Naples train took under 1.5 hours, and were super comfortable.

The majority of people I interacted with spoke at least basic English, and pretty much everybody understood it. This made interacting with people super easy. 

Pretty much didn't experience or notice any crime at all.

If anyone has any other questions/comments, feel free to let me know. Happy to be of any help!

You buy special gear and wallet to carry your money in Rome? Ever been to New York?? So I though about how an Italian tourist would think of the US, if they were to follow the same mindset.*

  
Hi all, we are a family of Italians. We are considering visiting New York but we are really unsure. Civil unrest concerns us. **The USA are a country where armed mobs stormed the parliament contesting the result of a democratic election, and there have recently been two attempts on a presidential candidate's life.** This stuff hasn't happened in Western Europe for a very long time - should we be worried?

  
**The homicide rate** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_intentional\_homicide\_rate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) **is 12x that of Italy, 10.5x Spain, 8x Germany**. In New York City it's about 10x that of Rome. What are the risks of getting killed? Should we wear bulletproof vests? 



We are also worried about driving standards. Getting a driving licence in the US is too easy, and the US allow on the roads stupid pedestrian-killing machines like the CyberTruck, which doesn't meet European safety standards. All the American expats we have met failed the driving test in Italy and had to retake it multiple times. Even normalising by miles driven, **road mortality in the US is much higher than in most European countries** (eg ca 2x that of the UK, no data found for Italy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_traffic-related\_death\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate) )

ItalyTravel,"Just got back from a great 2 weeks in Italy and fell for the hype re/ the crazed amalfi coast. Obviously it’s a beautiful place and we enjoyed the path of the gods, etc, but I couldn’t help but think that this is probably the worst time in history to travel here. Here’s my case:

1. Infrastructure woes: this is true across Italy but it’s clear the country is not positioned to accommodate the amount of tourism it gets. Every train and bus was either late, cancelled, or delayed due to track issues, traffic, being full, or strikes. It’s not clear that Italy has invested anything in the last ?30 years in this area. The amalfi coast was terrible in this regard as there are few options to travel between towns and within them. 

2. Price gouging: some of the worst I’ve seen across travelling to 25+ countries. I’m talking 40-50 euros for brief cab rides, 18 euro glasses of wine, etc. Because of the demand, shops and restaurants can charge whatever they want, making it ridiculously expensive.

3. Disneyland-like waits: for everything. If you love waiting, you’ll love the amalfi coast. Think your bus is coming in 10 minutes? Try 3 hours. Cute restaurant you want to try? Enjoy 2 hours in line. People are lined up everywhere to get the same picture of the same rock or beach or whatever.

4. Overcrowding: this really eliminated all charm from the area. There are so many people stuffed into the streets and restaurants that it’s hard to move. 

It’s a beautiful place, but I think it’s one to avoid until people find somewhere else to hype. I realize I’m part of the problem as a tourist adding to it, but I can’t think of a worse great place to travel to.

ItalyTravel,"I read a lot about traveling in Italy and watched lots of YouTube videos before coming here. Honestly, I was a bit worried about all the talk of scammers, aggressive street vendors, etc…

In reality, we had ZERO issue. I get that it’s a very limited sample size of staying in Rome for just 4 days (we are now in Tuscany staying at a villa we rented). We went to all of the touristy areas / sites - and absolutely no one harassed us, tried to scam us etc. 

Maybe we were lucky? I’m not downplaying or denying the accounts of other people who may have had a different / unpleasant experience here - but at least based on what I saw and experienced, people were neutral to very friendly. No hustlers aggressively coming up to you, no pickpocketers roaming around, no gypsies, etc.

My advice to you if you are first time traveling to Italy / Rome and a bit worried after reading about all these horror stories - relax.  You don’t have to act anything different than if you were traveling in NYC, LA, SF, Miami etc. We are from NYC so for us we acted no different than if we were back home. 

I would recommend though buying one of those cross-body bags you can wear around to keep your stuff safe and easily reachable by you.

Oh and we rented cars and drove up to Tuscany from Rome. Driving is super easy and felt safe here.
I didn’t think the drivers in Rome / Italy were aggressive or anything - in fact, I think driving in the NYC metro area is way worse and folks back home are way more aggressive on the road than here.  Watch out for the ZTL zones in big cities like Rome if you are driving, however.

ItalyTravel,"* You'll find yourself drinking A LOT more red wine than you normally do. Don't freak out after a BM the following morning. No, it's not internal bleeding. It's the wine that makes your poop look that way.
* Make sure you get a thing of Tums from Costco before you set foot in Italy. I went to Italy thinking ""Oh Italian food is cleaner and healthier than the crap I eat at home. Surely my belly won't hurt while I'm there"". Before you know it, you'll find yourself inhaling Ragu di Cinghiale like your life depends on it. I know I definitely did my bit in helping cull the wild boar population in Italy.
* Don't be a whiny little shit about how you don't like eggplant. Get some fiber with all that Cinghiale and order a Parmigiana di Melanzane with it. It'll be the best damn eggplant you've ever eaten.
* If a Gondolier in Venice or your Airbnb host tells you about their little favorite hole in the wall that ""all the locals eat at"", they're almost certainly pointing you to a tourist trap that no respectable Italian would eat at. Definitely don't eat there if all the reviews are from Swedes and Germans raving about the hamburger pizza.
* Use your damn gym membership for once and get your cardio game up before deciding to visit Italy. You're going to find yourself climbing more stairs than Rocky Balboa did training for his fight against Apollo Creed.
* If you decide to book a charming apartment from the 19th century, keep in mind they didn't build those with elevators in mind. If you have a wife and sister-in-law who decided to pack their entire wardrobe for this trip, you'll get to experience the immense pleasure of hauling all those suitcases up several flights of stairs.
* Before booking an Airbnb, make sure there's bathrooms with showers that can handle your average sized Midwesterner. Unfortunately, we had some family that were unable to fit into the shower stall one night after climbing several flights of the aforementioned stairs.
* Restaurant pro tip - Avoid anything you saw on Tiktok or Instagram. The best restaurants often tend to be the ones that don't have a website and has a bunch of old timers sitting outside day drinking and chain smoking.
* You may on occasion run into a server who gives you a confused look and tells you that you're ordering too much when you order ~~several~~ multiple entrees per person. Don't take it to heart. They just haven't met a Midwesterner yet.

ItalyTravel,"Hi there, Italian from Rome here. I just stumbled upon this sub and after reading a lot of posts I feel like you want to hear one advice or two.

You want to take a tour of our country? Great choice! You will see some of the most beautiful places in the entire world. Our cities are so full of art and history that it will blow your mind. Plus, the best cuisine in the world is waiting for you (if you avoid tourist traps at all costs!).

But, in order for you to have a pleasant experience and enjoy at least the most important landmarks, you will need AT THE VERY LEAST 3 full days (= days when you do not travel by train/bus/plane) for each major city you plan to visit (usually the regional capitals like Florence, Venice, Milan, Naples). And make it 4-5 for Rome: there are so many things to see here that even six months of continuous visiting may not be enough. Smaller centers, such as Sorrento, Amalfi, Siena, Ferrara or San Gimignano, can be visited in 2 days or even on a day trip.

Plus, I understand that not everyone is into museums. Fair enough. But if you skip even the most famous ones (like the Uffizi in Florence or the Vatican Museums), you're basically missing half of the trip. How can you skip Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel or the Birth of Venus by Botticelli? And the palaces themselves which host these museums are often worth visiting, take Palazzo Pitti in Florence with its beautiful gardens as an example. Make an effort and go visit at least one of them, you will not be disappointed.

And as a side note: Italy is not a small country. Sure, it's not the US or Russia, and our high-speed train network covers all the most popular destinations, allowing you to move from one city to another in a matter of a few hours (or less). But don't overestimate it. A train trip, including transfers from a hotel to the departing station and from the arriving station to a hotel, can easily take away half a day. And if you're planning a road trip, things don't get better: Italy is 1300 km long (800 miles for our American friends), the Apennine Mountains run across it, making it more difficult to move eastwards or westwards in the Center and the South, and the main motorways are often busy. It's definitely doable and perhaps the best way to explore Italy, but you will need much more time. And that brings me to my ultimate conclusion.

If you seriously think of doing some extreme city-hopping madness like I have read many times here, something like 2 days Rome (Colosseum and Vatican are not the only things there, folks), then 1 day Venice (why, just so you can take a selfie on a gondola then head back to the hotel?), then 4 days Sorrento (???) and 1 day Lake Como (that lake isn't small, you know?), do not even bother coming. You will waste your money, you will not understand a thing, you will rush it and will likely end up so tired that you'll wish to be on your return flight as soon as possible. Just stay home and watch Italy on Street View from the comfort of your sofa.

Of course, all of this is valid if you're genuinely interested and plan on making the most out of your trip to Italy. If you're the kind of tourist who watches a Tik Tok about #LakeComo and then decides to board a plane just to take a selfie in the same spot, well, who am I to stop you?

ItalyTravel,"My husband and I (from US) are wrapping up our two week trip to Europe (mostly Italy, last couple days in Greece). We both have pretty severe digestive issues, lactose intolerance, probable IBS, etc. and have been AMAZED at how good we felt in Italy. Bread and dairy tend to be triggers for us, and we ate whatever we wanted (all the pizza, pasta, gelato, you name it) and never once did we have any issues, and I never felt bloated a single time which is a huge deal for me. Now 24 hours in Greece and we both feel terrible again. We are not looking forward to going back to the states and feeling like this all the time 😅.
I know a large part of the issue is that the US allows all kinds of preservatives, pesticides, and processed foods that aren’t allowed in many other countries. Has anyone found any reliable products that are sourced in Italy (or other countries with similar food standards), or had any luck finding Italian markets in the US with products from Italy? 
We have both been trying to improve our health this year, and if we could consistently eat foods that made us feel as good as the food in Italy that would be a game changer. Unfortunately I don’t see us being able to move to Europe anytime soon 😭

ItalyTravel,"I know, I know, you’ve heard all the horror stories—pickpockets in Rome, getting ripped off in tourist traps, chaotic traffic in Naples. But after three trips to Italy this year, I’ve got to say... none of that happened to me. Not once. Instead, every visit has been pure magic, and I think I’m officially addicted.

Let's start with Rome. The Eternal City gets a lot of flak for being too touristy, too crowded, too hot. But honestly? It was nothing short of spectacular. Sure, the Colosseum area is packed, but that’s because it’s freaking incredible. A little tip: get there early, book a tour, and you’ll avoid the worst of the crowds. And the food? I avoided the obvious traps and found some tiny trattorias where the pasta is made fresh and the wine flows like water. Oh, and the gelato… let’s just say I probably ate my weight in it, and it was worth every calorie.

Then there’s Naples, which I know has a reputation that scares some people off. But let me tell you, the city is a gem. I walked the streets both day and night, never felt unsafe, and honestly, the worst thing that happened was a minor case of heartburn from eating too much pizza (which was easily the best I’ve ever had). The city’s raw energy is something you can’t describe—you just have to experience it. I even drove around a bit, and despite what people say, the traffic was manageable. Just be assertive and you’ll be fine.

My latest trip took me through Tuscany, and wow... those rolling hills, the vineyards, the cypress-lined roads—it's like stepping into a postcard. I rented a car and had zero issues. No unexpected charges, no toll booth drama, nothing. Just miles of breathtaking views and some of the most relaxing days I’ve ever spent. The locals were so welcoming, and every meal felt like it was cooked by an Italian grandma who wanted to spoil me rotten. And yes, the wine was *chef's kiss*.

Across all three trips, I never got robbed, scammed, or even yelled at (except maybe by a particularly enthusiastic waiter who was just really passionate about his pasta). The weather was fantastic every time—blue skies, warm sun, perfect for exploring. Even the little inconveniences, like the occasional long line or slightly pricey cappuccino, just felt like small sacrifices for the chance to experience such an amazing country.

So yeah, maybe I’m just lucky, or maybe Italy is just as wonderful as I’ve always dreamed it would be.

ItalyTravel,"I have spent more than three years in Italy and am currently here again on a two-month trip. On this trip I have rented a few vacation rental apartments and several have been on the ground floor. One thing I’ve noticed on this trip that I haven’t experienced before is how many tourists trespass onto private property for pictures.

In one place I rented people were constantly posing for photos with my front door (annoying but what can do you?) but shockingly worse is that people would film TikTok’s where they opened and closed the exterior shutters of my house!  What is going through their heads?! 

My current rental was not supposed to be ground floor but I was kindly moved to accommodate an early check-in. My apartment has a small terrace in front with two stone benches that are literally carved into the wall. People have been taking photos on the terrace all the time, but today a family came, sat on the benches, and proceeded to shout for 10+ minutes. I finally came out to ask them to move and be quiet and they became enraged. I eventually got them to move by filming them (which they did not like one bit!), and they just went across the street and did it at the house opposite mine! 

I’m here for two months and whatever, but it breaks my heart to think of the local people who are experiencing this violation of their privacy every day. The family from my terrace allowed their daughter to LEAN THROUGH a ground floor window, into someone’s home, for a photo!  I have seen the man who lives there and he is elderly and doesn’t seem to speak English - what could he possibly do about a child leaning halfway through his window? 

This is just a reminder to other people visiting Italy that people actually live here and just as you wouldn’t want strangers in your yard, opening and closing your windows for TikTok, the local people here don’t want that either. Give them some space and consider your volume when you’re around people’s doors and windows, especially at night.

ItalyTravel,"Okay, I figured this sub would appreciate this.

My wife and I are on our honeymoon in Tuscany. BEAUTIFUL. First time.

We were off the beaten path at a farmhouse restaurant just outside Montepulciano and had a wonderful experience. 10/10 service and 10/10 food. 

I’m driving and boy are these roads thin.

So, as we were leaving the restaurant, I make too wide of a turn and one tire slips off the road and straight into a ditch. A DEEP ditch. Definitely bad driving - I take 100% of the blame, but damn that ditch was way too deep lol.

We went back to ask our server if the farm had a tractor to pull us out… 

Shoutout our server. Such an amazing human being, they did not, but he offered to help ask the farm across the street if they could help.

On our walk in, we heard some light quacking… The server warned us that the neighbors had some aggressive ducks. Turned out these were some trained guard ducks. They quacked and screamed louder than any ducks I’ve heard and tried to attack us.

Just as they did, a woman peaked her head out to sush the ducks and ask us what we wanted.

The waiter explained the situation and next thing we knew, the grandfather, father, and his 4 sons (with their young daughter watching and laughing) brought their tractor, hooked up to our rental, and pulled us right out.

God bless this country and its people. 

I feel blessed, embarrassed, and humbled, but my wife and I can not stop laughing at what just happened.

ItalyTravel,"I’m an Australian and just returned from 5 weeks in Italy in September and would like to address a couple of things that others might feel helpful.

I went to: Milan, Lake Como, Bologna, Florence, Tuscany, Polignano a Mare, Sorrento and Rome. 

Accomodation: Definitely didn’t skimp on accommodation but also didn’t stay in 5 star hotels. Stayed in a mix of hotels/ apartments and booked mostly through booking.com with no issues. 

Driving: rented a car for 9 days. Picking up and dropping off at an airport made life a lot easier to avoid limited traffic areas and traffic in general. Driving wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Drivers outside of the major cities were fine and you could easily move out of the way. I still probably wouldn’t recommend renting a car unless it’s absolutely necessary (mostly due to the price and alternative transport options). If you do rent a car - rent from a reputable company and get the max insurance. 

Transport: The Trenitalia fast trains are elite. We had 2 large suitcases and didn’t have issue. Some trains have luggage racks at the end of each carriage but most you have to put overhead. Public transport in each major city is easy to understand. Caught taxis a few places which was also easy to use. Most cities use various apps to order taxis much like Uber (some give you estimated prices too). 

The only thing I would say is set up the taxi apps before you leave the country as you have to verify your number for most of them. I had an e-sim which only had data (Airalo) but could still make calls on WhatsApp. 

Uber: Uber does exist however, they only have the Uber black which is essentially like hiring a professional driver. We used it a couple of times and thought it was great. Definitely wouldn’t recommend it in all circumstances as it’s expensive and cabs are a better option. 

Safety: There’s scams everywhere but easily avoidable if you firmly say no. Generally I felt safer in Italy than I do in Melbourne. Pick pocketing was non existent or I didn’t notice. I used common sense and a small crossbody bag in the massive tourist spots. 

Food/Coffee: Amazing. Tourists traps everywhere but use common sense and google and you’ll be fine. Staff are never really rushing you to leave your table so take your time if you can. You’ll have to flag someone down most of the time to get the bill. Coffee very different to Australia but there’s something special about Italian coffee culture. 

Activities: we booked pretty much everything in advance direct from the website (ie: Vatican, Colosseum, museums, etc). Seemed to be the most affordable. Most attractions had long lines to buy tickets on the day. Also for the most part skip the line tickets aren’t real. If you’ve booked a ticket for a time-slot- you’re getting in with everyone else so don’t waste your money on a third party ticket if it’s more expensive than the website. Tour groups are a different story though and can usually use alternative entrances and lines. 

The people: the Italian people are amazing. Everyone who works in hospitality/service in major cities speak a good amount of English. My wife speaks Italian almost fluently so that helped a lot. For the most part everyone was lovely. Italians are generally extremely laid back (so when the last ferry for the day gets cancelled they can be a bit blasé about it all) but still amazing people.

Something else I’ve learnt as a general rule: most people will only review/post on reddit if they’ve had a really bad experience so do extensive research before you listen to what one negative person has to say.

All in all, a fantastic trip.

ItalyTravel,"There have been a ton of posts recently in this group and also in r/Rome and r/Florence with people’s horror stories about getting robbed, scammed etc. usually in the larger cities.  

Please note that while you always have to be observant and know what is around you, we did not find cities in Italy to be any different than any other large cities we have travelled.  You might have to be a little rude to the bracelet scammers around the tourist areas but if they realize you aren’t  an easy mark, they will move onto the next one.  Men, keep your wallet and phone in your front pocket, not the back.  Bring minimal cash and maybe one credit card with you when you are out and leave the wallet in the room.  Ladies, minimize the fancy jewelry and get a good cross-body bag and keep it with the zipper in the front.  These are ideas not unique to Italy.

* **I'm really glad** I did my very best to learn and speak Italian. Even if I’m emphasizing the wrong syllable in a word, even if I end up blending in some English, I can tell the locals appreciate it. Also, Duolingo sucks ass. I learned more in a few days of simply immersing myself in the city, reading signs, listening to others, etc. than I did in the 70+ days of Duolingo lessons.

* **I'm also really glad** I brought some comfortable sneakers.

* **I really regret** falling for one of those dreaded tourist trap restaurants - Otello alla Concordia. We had originally tried to get into Ristorante Dilla, but they were fully booked, so we just went next door. We didn’t really lurk much longer because we were pretty hungry and they had a table immediately available, so we sat down. So, so, so *gross.*

* I realize this might contradict the above, but **I also regret** dwelling and obsessing so much on finding the absolute """"""BEST"""""" restaurants according to reddit or wherever. Funny enough, one of the more disappointing meals we had was at CiPasso (one of reddit’s more commonly suggested places; starters were super tasty but entrees were meh). One of the best meals was actually our first night when we just wandered into Baccano without a reservation after walking around Trevi Fountain. Do a bit of research, make a few reservations, but I would absolutely encourage you to take a chance and try some places you didn’t expect to go. Yes, there’s always a chance it will backfire and you won’t like your meal. There’s also a chance you’ll be extremely pleasantly surprised. 

* **I can’t get over the fact that** (in many small Italian towns) you need to go into a tobacco shop to buy a bus ticket. Truly a foreign concept to this silly ass American.

* **Google Translate is a lifesaver.** Especially in a smaller town like Tivoli where most locals just don’t speak English, I was able to communicate decently well, order food, ask for directions, etc. by Google Translating things on my phone and showing it to them.

* **My take on pickpockets** (at the risk of contributing even more dialogue to a subject that's already beaten to death): I think I scared myself shitless from reading all of the posts on r/ItalyTravel and r/Rome about pickpockets and petty thievery that, from the perspective of everyone around me in a metro station, I probably looked like an absolute freak, clutching the fanny bag across my chest, with [a crazed, wide-eyed look](https://media1.tenor.com/m/iJlsJTEJtN4AAAAC/thats-so-raven-raven-symone.gif).

* In reality, I realized that **Rome is truly no different than any other large city** in the sense that you will be perfectly fine as long as you follow these simple rules: 1.) Carry as few personal valuable items as you can (Do you REALLY need all 6 credit cards? Do you REALLY need all that cash? Do you REALLY need your passport today? etc.). 2.) Know where your belongings are at all times, and hang onto them when you’re in a crowd. 3.) Be aware of your personal surroundings. 4.) Have some common sense. That’s really it.

* My wife and I are 100% convinced we did see a pair of pickpockets at the Termini metro stop. They were two young girls - I’d guess late teens / early 20s. And, **we were startled by how *obvious* they were pickpockets**. All you have to do is watch their eyes. These two would just scan the waist areas of everyone around them. Move to a different vantage point, scan some more. Occasionally whisper to each other, etc. They’re just looking for EASY marks who aren’t paying any attention. If they notice you noticing them, they're just going to move somewhere else, much farther away, so they can find some other hapless tourist.

* **I wish I had purchased a 3- or 7-day pass and used the Metro sooner.** I think I freaked myself out so much with the pickpocket fear mongering that I simply didn’t expect nor plan to use the metro very often. Once I had my first metro experience and, more *critically*, once I realized how stupid-simple it was, I felt like the entire city of Rome had opened up to me. But now, it's kind of too late, because we have a bunch of day trips planned for the rest of our time here. I lived in NYC, for crying out loud. No offense to Rome, but going from NYC metro to Rome metro is like going from Pythagorean Theorem to counting Skittles.

* As a Southeast Asian American, I was also curious to see how I would be ‘received’ in Italy, especially after reading some personal accounts on here of perceived racism from other Asian tourists. Not to discount those experiences, but I truly did not personally detect any racism, at all. I definitely got some longer-than-normal stares, but probably more so because I just looked like a very out of place American tourist. **Every Italian I met was either extremely warm and friendly or completely apathetic** to my existence. No one was ever actively rude to me.

* How are there not more **automobile-related deaths** every single day? I am literally clenching my ass every time I'm in a car. I still haven't been able to decipher pedestrian and driver etiquette here.

* I've lived in or visited several large U.S. cities, and it's remarkable how comparatively few unsheltered individuals there are on the streets of Rome. Also, a complete lack of **public mental health crises**. We've been joking that readily-accessible gelato is the solution to the latter.

ItalyTravel,"Hi, after having seen many posts saying ""yeah skip Milan"", I'd like to give my point of view.  
As all reviews, my opinion is just what I see, in other words, It's how I filter the world through my interests.  
So take it as a subjective opinion.  
I'm from Milan (milanese) and I lived in other cities in Italy and abroad in Europe as well.  
Among my interests there's surely history, art, music and food. this is why I would focus the post on these aspects.

Let's dispel the first myth: **Go to Milan just for shopping**  
No doubts that Milan gained its fame thank to the fashion industry.  
This is how it became world famous in the '80s but nowadays this kind of definition is outdated.  
If in the past Milan was seen as a business hub, grey and always with a thick layer of mist, this is not true anymore. Milan is the city in Italy that evolved at the fastest rate over the last decades.  
While all the other major Italian cities reinforced and preserved their ""local"" traits, Milan embraced more the internationalism and evolved in a different way.

To sum up, what to expect in Milan

**Art, a lot**

* Milan went through many different architectural eras, depending on who was ruling the city at that time: Visconti, Sforza, the French, the Spaniards, the Austrians
* Milan has been the heart of the Italian design and architecture. So in the extended city centre you'll find a lot of different styles. Some examples:
   * Roman time - [Basilica di San Lorenzo](https://milantips.com/colonne_di_san_lorenzo.html) ([gmaps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j4kE88oyWFb9r5mG6)). You can also have a [roman-ruins walking tour](https://3giorniamilano.it/en/tours-milan/milan-roman-empire). The [Sant'Ambrogio Basilica ](https://www.yesmilano.it/en/see-and-do/venues/basilica-of-sant-ambrogio)(patron saint of Milan) ([gmaps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ex1im3drbWSwYQtm8)) built 379->1099
   * Gothic & Medieval Time: the Duomo of Milan of course, built from 1548 to 1577 (completed in 1932), includes several styles like gothic, neogothic and neoclassic. Even though it's a blend of local and Europea gothic. It's one of the few churches in the world where you can walk on its rooftop.. and admire the sunset if you want. All the gates built at medieval time and the [Sforza Castle](https://www.milan-museum.com/sforza-castle.php) as well
   * [Renaissance](https://www.finestresullarte.info/en/travel/the-renaissance-in-milan-10-places-to-see-in-the-city): of course Leonardo's Last Supper! Leonardo spent more time in Milan than in Florence and he left numerous traces. You can even visit its [vineyard](https://www.vignadileonardo.com/en), rebuilt thanks to seeds found in his original home in Milan.

**Lifestyle**

* Milan never sleeps we say. In fact the amount of artistic, music events is never ending. You should check in advance what the [biggest ones are and book](https://www.yesmilano.it/en/whats-on).
   * The design week is pretty well known and for a week Milan becomes an open air exhibition place where hundreds of private villas open to host presentations, artworks etc.

**Live Music**

* [Nidaba Theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tk9CPADk97ZhUQQh9). In my opinion simply the best pub where to see a live concert. Almost one every day in this small and cozy pub. They typically play blues, country, rock, rockabilly etc

* [Spirit de Milan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZkiDzLzPSbS1mG7): factory which became a restaurant with high space to dance in. Recommended for evenings with friends. You can dance rock, swing with live music

**Areas**

As explained above, Milan is a layered city which went through many different periods and this is reflected also in the many different districts.  
Apart from the city centre, you should definitely visit the Navigli (artificial canal ares) with the hundreds of restaurants and cocktail bars and enjoy an evening in the vibrant scene of the Navigli.  
Explore the Paolo Sarpi are aka China Town.  
Despite not being so wide, the Chinese presence here dates back to the beginning of the '900.

Some areas to explore:

* City Centre (Duomo, Galleria, La Scala, Quadrilatero della Moda, Castello Sforzesco, Parco Sempione, Brera
* Isola, Corso Garibaldi, the financial dinstrict which is now also a well known aggregation point
* CityLife, modern skyscraper district and apartments surrounded by a huge green area
* Paolo Sarpi (china town) - Amazing for the food scene!
* Naviglio Grande/Pavese (Milan’s Canals), Darsena, Porta Ticinese (especially for the evening Aperitivo/Dinner is the place to go)
* Porta Romana, area full of bars, restaurants, Roman walls as well and a well known SPA
* Porta Venezia, Giardini Indro Montanelli and all the area around, really recommended for exploring the Liberty style in Milan and the flamingos at [villa Invernizzi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GwtNB1PMzehSxxee9)!

**Food**

Over the years Milan became more international and embraced fusion cuisines and nowadays is the perfect city where to find ethical restaurants and Italian regional restaurants as well.  
Milanese cuisine got a bit lost despite you can still find good restaurants, they are not as common as in the past. Some of them:  
\- [La Pesa dal 1902 ](https://www.trattorialapesa1902.it/?lang=en)(Risotto alla Milanese, Ossobuco, Cotoletta are their specialties)  
\-[ Al Garghet](https://algarghet.it) (as above)

In Milan you can find among the best fish in Italy as well. This is because the Milan Fish Market (the biggest of Southern Europe) receives fresh fish daily to be sold to the restaurants. The unsold fish comes back to the seller of the original region.

If you end up in Milan around Christmas, don't miss the panettone, handmade prepared by many patisserie. My favourite is the one from Pave.

**Why not to visit Milan**

* If you have a really tight schedule in Italy, like a few days, Milan is not representative of the typical Italian town but it resembles cosmopolitan cities such as Paris or London.  Italian towns are characterised by a strong belonging feeling, with local art, food and a strong parochialism (being proud of your own town and hating a little bit the neighbouring towns :D, this is very common in Italy). For this reason Milan is not representative of Italy.
* If you only care of: I was in Italy - with a subsequent IG-like picture. Probably do that in Venice. Even though Venice is an amusement park. The local people disappeared from the city, which actually became an open air shop. Amazing town but it became something else over the years...

ItalyTravel,"Just got back from about 2 weeks in Italy and my wife and I both learned enough to order, and ask questions and at a minimum ask to speak English if it was complicated.

Not only did it make ordering food or other service conversations easier, but people were thrilled that we tried to learn and speak their language. Most understood english, or our basic Italian, but I had several people note that they were surprised we knew Italian. 

We both did online learning (duolingo and Pimsleur) and it was easy and great.

ItalyTravel,"Kind of depressed having to come home. Feel like I needed a few months in Italy and not just 12 days. But I will be back for sure, as it was the best vacation I've been on in my 30 years.

Takeaways: 

-Italian has to be the most beautiful sounding language I've ever heard.

-Not having AC didn't turn out to be as much of a problem as I thought it would.

-Stores have different hours compared to US. Say goodbye to 24 hour shops. A lot of stores close by 5 to prepare for dinner. Some will be open from 6am-12am and then again from 2-5pm. Others will just be randomly closed for a couple days.

-Italians have the best work-life balance

-Cool little stores/shops in every little nook and cranny on the streets of every Italian city

-Dinner doesn't start until 7 and some don't even go out until 11 or 12am, so don't act surprised when there's no one eating at a resteraunt at 5pm

-the real party's begin late at nate

-Still haven't figured out how to properly use Italian divets

-Every city has an incredible Duomo. Highly recommend checking out Firenze 

-Try not to get nervous driving through Italian city's where cars are inches away from crashing into you and hordes of crowds suffocate you from both sides. Prepare to move at a snails pace

-Get a vespa or bike if you can. Parking is infinitely easier then.

- *important* make sure you know what roads are closed. My family must have racked up over 200 euros in fines from driving through restricted areas of a city

-NEVER look at a car when crossing the street. Just keep going. If you look, Roman drivers will think you are stopping and will continue to drive on. (Learned this one from my tourist guide.)

-Don't get offended when Italian drivers overtake you or cut you off on the road. Italian drivers are crazy, but there's a method to the madness. It's pretty much jungle law on the roads. If you can drive in Italy you can drive anywhere.

-Dont tip at resteraunts

-The Italian countryside (Tuscany region in particular) is like you died and went to heaven. I have never seen such beautiful foliage in my life before. 

-the streets and lanes are very tiny compared to the US, given Italys ancient and medieval heritage.

-Cars are also super tiny. It's almost like everyone has a smart car (which makes sense given the space requirements in Italy)

I'm sure there's more and will update this when I can think of them.

ItalyTravel,"Just want to add to this forum because it did freak me out before I ventured on my own to Italy. The posts on here made me afraid to travel. This is my first solo trip after a major break up (F32), and luckily I can say Italy is perfect. 

Landed in Rome, took the local train to Roma’s main train station. Took the train to Florence. Have my own airbnb apartment. Ventured Florence on my own. Took the high speed train to Venice and ventured on my own. Heading to Sorrento and Rome after Florence. 

Biked around. Did the Gondola ride. Drank lots of aperol spritz drinks. Did a vespa ride  in Tuscany. 

No pickpocketing or dangerous vibes at all. Men were very respectful and Italians have been very kind. No train or taxi issues. I want redditors to know that I feel safer here than in New York (where I was born, raised and currently live), so don’t be scared of Italy. Travelers, just remain alert and enjoy!

Adding important info from comments:

Best travel apps that have helped me greatly:

•	⁠apptaxi: for taxi rides (cheaper than uber)
•	⁠Italo Treno: cheaper train. I used it for my train from Rome to Florence
•	⁠Trenitalia: for high speed trains. Used this from florence to/from venice. And will use it from florence to naples/sorrento 
•	⁠ridemovi: for the city bikes
•	⁠google translate: can even translate words and signs
•	⁠trip advisor and viator: for tours and events


For one day in Florence:

•	⁠Ponte Vecchio: super old bridge with medieval shops that weren’t destroyed during WWII (free)
•	⁠Piazzale Michelangelo: panoramic views of the city. The restaurant up there was featured in the netflix show, From Scratch. Pretty good food (free + restaurant costs)
•	⁠Duomo: make sure to cover your shoulders and legs but get to the top! Amazing views. Get a skip the line ticket!
•	⁠if you needed to go to one museum: Galleria dell’accademia - the David is gorgeous! Michelangelo’s art, from his teens to whenever he passed, is so amazing to see in person

ItalyTravel,"* Food and groceries are very affordable. People travelling with me said often it's a third of the cost of other European countries.  Even in the middle of busy tourist areas.  I had a $2 slice of pizza near the Vatican, for example.
* Renting a car is immensely enjoyable, even for a few days.  It's easy for short days trips to Pisa from Florence, or exploring Amalfi Coast.  AAA in America will give you an international driver permit for $20.
* Trains and shuttles can be avoided if you have three or more travelers.  Taxis take four people.  Private car service for five or more is reasonable costs.
* Yelling 'pickpocket' is acceptable and will instantly get people away from you.  I did it one place where my friend was victimized the following day.  (I mention this because I didn't imagine I was targeted)
* Most dishes have zero meat in them so you really have to look.
* Be aware of which locations have steps.  They are 2-3X more difficult than people describe.
* Beaches with pebble instead of sands are now my favorite.  I never liked getting sand all over me.

ItalyTravel,"After reading some posts here, I had some initial concerns about potential scams in Italy, but my two-week trip turned out to be the best travel experience of my life.

I started with 4 nights in Rome, visiting the Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum, St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican Museum, and the papal churches. 

I then moved south and spent time in Sorrento, using it as a base to explore Naples (went to the archaeological museum, had the Neapolitan pizza at Sorbillo, da Michele) and Pompeii, which was a major highlight.

My final stops were 3 days in Florence, where I visited the Uffizi Gallery and Galleria dell'Accademia, and 2 days in Bologna.

One key piece of advice: avoid the free Sundays at places like the Vatican or Uffizi; the overwhelming crowds make the experience less enjoyable.

The food was phenomenal, and the trip was more affordable compared to other European destinations I had travelled to previously like Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. As a solo traveler, I found Italy both exciting and manageable. Definitely don't be put off by what you read here at times, plan properly and discover the country on your own! Will definitely be back.

ItalyTravel,"My daughter had a fever while we were in Cinque Terre, so the next morning we took the train to La Spezia. I intended to visit an urgent care clinic, but they were either closed for the day ( Saturday) or on a break. Across the street was the hospital complex, which included a pediatric hospital (Pronto Soccorso Pediatrico di La Spezia). We went to the pediatrico emergency room entrance, and waited for about 30 minutes to be let into the waiting room. We spent another 30 minutes in the waiting room before a nurse brought us into the reception area and took our daughters information. While we were waiting we wrote a journal of our daughters symptoms and her essential information and medical history. We pasted this into Google Translate and the nurse was able to admit our daughter. The nurse knew about as much English as we do Italian but we were able to communicate well enough through Google or gesturing. 

After another 30 minutes or so we were brought to a very simple room, with an adult bed and infant crib. Eventually the doctor came by and fortunately she spoke passable English. They did a urine test and blood work. We waited and waited and waited. About 19:00 the doctor returned, explained how the tests showed our daughter had an infection and gave her a prescription for amoxicillin. We asked the doctor how do we pay our bill and she explained there was no bill and we were free to go. We filled the paper prescription at the farmacia, which cost €2.48. 

We spent about eight hours in the hospital. Unfortunately we didn’t pack a lunch, and it was never clear when the doctor was going to visit, so we didn’t try to find the cafeteria, which was probably in another building. 

The care was excellent, though much slower than our experience in the US. It was a shock to not receive a bill when we left.

ItalyTravel,"32M from Los Angeles, CA. I visited Italy for 2 weeks this past March on a solo trip. This was my first visit to Italy.

I stayed at a mix of hotels and Airbnbs in the following cities, traveling by Trenitalia trains:

**Venice** (3 nights) – One of the most unique cities I’ve visited. Beautiful and delightfully weird. The main sights are iconic, but getting lost in the canals and alleys has its own fun surprises. The canals have a briny smell, but it didn’t bother me; makes for more vivid memories.

* **Highlights:** Doge’s Palace, St. Mark’s Square, San Giorgio Maggiore (amazing views from campanile), Frari Church, aimlessly wandering on foot and by boat

**Verona** (1 night) – Gorgeous! Very pleasant city to just stroll with a gelato and take in the sights. I would’ve loved an additional day here to go more in-depth with museums and churches. But even with limited time, the Arena and general cityscape are very much worth seeing.

* **Highlights:** Verona Arena, Roman Theatre & Archaeological Museum, Castelvecchio, Verona Cathedral, Torre dei Lamberti, any viewpoint along the Adige River

**Milan** (2 nights) – The sleeper hit. I *loved* this place. The breadth of architectural variety – Renaissance, Art Nouveau, contemporary, medieval, Ancient Roman – is staggering. It’s elegant with just the right amount of grit, and very energetic throughout. My favorite city in Italy.

* **Highlights:** Milan Cathedral (incredible), Sforza Castle, UniCredit Tower, Bosco Verticale, Da Vinci’s *The Last Supper* at Santa Maria delle Grazie

**Florence** (3 nights) – Weekend crowds and rain impacted my experience. That said, the main landmarks are really cool, the art is incredible, and the city is teeming with fascinating history. Tuscany is a really lovely setting. Funnily enough, there seemed to be more Americans here than Italians (lots of students and spring breakers).

* **Highlights:** Duomo, Uffizi Gallery, Accademia Gallery, Palazzo Vecchio, view from Piazzale Michelangelo
* **Day Trip: Pisa** – The Leaning Tower is surreal to see in person. Watching everyone take their silly pictures with the Tower out-of-context is hilarious (I took one too – it’s fun!). The Cathedral is underrated and absolutely worth a visit, as is the Camposanto. Neat architectural gems throughout the city.

**Assisi** (1 night) – Excellent choice for the Italian hill town experience. Halfway between Florence and Rome, spectacular views of Umbria, a captivating Basilica, awesome castle ruins, and a cozy stone aesthetic throughout. Nice break from the larger, busier cities.

* **Highlights:** Basilica of St. Francis (stunning frescoes), Rocca Maggiore, aimlessly wandering on foot

**Rome** (4 nights) – Unparalleled. The main sights are incomprehensibly huge, and overwhelming in historical importance. The city is surprisingly cleaner and less crowded than I expected. Very easy to get around on foot and by bus. I loved discovering the less famous ruins and churches throughout. So much to enjoy here.

* **Highlights:** Colosseum, Roman Forum, Victor Emmanuel Monument, St. Peter’s Basilica, Vatican Museums (Sistine Chapel details are remarkable), Castel Sant’Angelo, Baths of Caracalla, Pantheon, Trastevere (so cute!)

**Food & Drink Thoughts:**

* Meal quality can vary widely. But when it’s good, it’s outstanding.
* Contrary to popular belief, the presence of an English menu at a restaurant has zero impact on food quality.
* Food courses vary a lot in size. For some meals, one pasta course wasn’t enough and I had to add a side dish. But other times, one pasta or meat course was plenty.
* Pasta highlights: Cappellacci di Bufala, Tagliatelle al Ragù, Spaghetti Carbonara
* Regional dishes worth trying: Horsemeat Stew with Potato Gnocchi, Risotto all’Ossobuco, Ribollita, Seppie al Nero con Polenta, Lampredotto
* Pizza and paninis are everywhere and an inexpensive way to fill up.
* Gelato really is *that* good. Favorite flavor combos: cacao/banana, pear/crema with chocolate chips.
* Italian breakfast pastries are tasty, but more limited in selection than those found in France or Germany. Try a Cornetto al Pistacchio, Rocciata, or Fritella alla Crema.
* I love the rhythm of Italian espresso bar culture, but it can be confusing. Some places have you pay before you receive your drink, some after.
* Wine/spirit highlights: Traboçco Trebbiano D’Abruzzo (white wine), La Veneranda Riccardo I (red wine), Campari Spritz (refreshingly bitter if Aperol is too sweet for you)

**General Thoughts:**

* Italians are so hospitable! Whether a hotel/Airbnb host, server, barista, or random person on the street, everyone goes out of their way to help and make sure you have a good time.
* Many Italians speak English, but to varying degrees, and some not at all. I got by alright with basic Italian phrases and Google Translate.
* The Italian language is a joy to hear from native speakers. Very buoyant, lots of bobs and weaves.
* Italian culture is very musical. You’ll likely hear an older gentleman break into an a cappella aria, or pass a bar full of youths belting along to an Oasis song.
* You see more young people out and about in Italy than you do in the US.
* Dachshunds and Pomeranians are very popular dogs.
* Many public toilets do not have seats.
* Smoking is very common. It was kind of a running gag: whenever I’d step aside on a narrow street to let a car or vespa pass, someone would emerge from a door next to me for their cigarette break.
* Italian public transport is pretty timely and organized, not the “chaotic” stereotype at all. Trenitalia trains are great for travel between cities. Buses and trams are pretty reliable within cities. The Milan Metro is fantastic.
* I love Italy. The people, architecture, art, history, food, and natural beauty are infinitely charming and likable. An absolute knockout of a country. I would happily return to any of the above cities and look forward to exploring Naples, Turin, Sicily, Cinque Terre, etc.
* To any Italians reading this: Thank you for making an American feel welcome in your wonderful country!

**Budget:**

* Total: $4,250
   * Flights: $1000 via Air France (LAX to VCE, layover in CDG; FCO to LAX, layover in CDG)
   * Hotels & Airbnbs: $1720 (Rome, Milan, and Venice most expensive)
   * Train/Bus Tickets Between Cities: $130 (bought in advance, except Pisa day trip)
   * Daily Expenses: $1400 (food, sight admissions, Metro/bus/tram fares, etc.)

ItalyTravel,"Milan - I went there three times and stayed in three different spots around the city. Staying near the duomo feels like the best experience. Good for younger tourists, more nightlife

Rome - I stayed near termini. Big mistake for a solo female traveller I did not feel safe during the day let alone at night near this area and in various parts of Rome. The sightseeing is nice but im not interested in returning. The lines and crowds and unfriendly people didn’t do it for me

Lake Como - I stayed in Bellagio. Incredibly beautiful place. Nobody wanted to give me a table in a restaurant. Lines were ridiculous for restaurants and ferries

Cinque Terre - I stayed in Monterosso. There’s not much to do besides attend beach but I was happy with that. I had a great time but I don’t think I’d return

Portofino - day tripped here. Beautiful place, loved exploring here. Sooo expensive. 

Florence - I stayed right next to the duomo. I had a lot of fun roaming the streets and shopping here. 

Venice - day tripped here. Big mistake. Probably needed at least one night here. The last ferry back to the station was around 6pm and does not give you enough time to explore. Ferries were so busy and lines were long. Wasn’t a very good experience - combined with missing my booked gondola ride due to the packed out ferries

Ancona - an authentic non tourist hotspot city, great food and beaches. Very quiet.

Puglia - the highlight of my entire trip. Polignano a mare, monopoli, trani, ostuni, Bari - best food, best vibe, beaches. 10/10

Matera - a must see in your lifetime. Day tripped here. What an incredible experience it was. Lots of stairs and walking but worth it.

Amalfi coast - I stayed in Sorrento and did day trips to Positano and Capri. This was the right choice. Sorrento was fantastic. Positano was a nightmare with all of the stairs and it was so expensive. A tourist trap. Great for couples. Capri was a nice experience.

Sardinia - I stayed in cala gonone. The most beautiful beaches I could have ever imagined. I’m so glad I went here. Great for couples. Good prices and I didn’t see any non Italian tourists. 

Next trip I will surely go back to Puglia and keen to go to Calabria and Sicily also. ",t2_29t4zgyc,My review of travelling various Italian cities in August 2024,0.93,251,1725461353.0,1725461353.0,141,TRAPPERX12,1f8v8n6
ItalyTravel,"Italian here, love my country & visited most of it, I try to help sometimes here in the sub telling tourists they could have such a better experience in Italy adding a couple underrated places (I did 2 AMAs with suggestions about it) instead of doing Romeflorencevenicein7days itineraries. Also helping our overtourism (in some locations) problem.

Same is for food. Ok, today nearly everyone knows that italian cuisine is not just pasta & pizza and that it's much more complex.  
But here in the sub I still see that few understand that italian real cuisine is EXTREMELY regional and that (unless you're in a tourist trap) the menu varies totally from one italian city to another.  
History explains it well: after Romans, Italy have been divided into different states for 1400 years (just before ""recent"" independence there were 8 italian states), developing in centuries different cultures of their own and having different foreign influences (by Austrians see cuisine of Milan/Veneto, by French see cuisine of Turin, by Spanish/Arabs see cuisine of Sicily).  
As another example, Tuscany food & Emilia-Romagna food (Bologna, Modena, Parma), 2 regions nearby, with the 2 main cities only 30 minutes away today by train, have both 2 famous cuisines but totally different (I mean different as Paris' and Berlin's..).

So, suggestion: don't always take the usual dishes that you also find in Italian restaurants abroad (ok, in Italy are different, but..), inform yourself and try regional specialties that you only find in the region/place where you are. Taking a Carbonara not in Rome area (and sometimes even in Rome..) is often a mistake, while it's almost impossible to find bad Tortellini in Bologna or a terrible Arancino in Sicily.

ItalyTravel,"NOTE: By any means I am NOT trying to be rude or to make people angry. Just trying to understand the reason.

So, I was travelling in three cities in Italy (Milano, Bologna, and Rome). It was a good experience, beautiful cities and culture.

But, I couldn't help but notice that there was garbage on the streets.

I live in an eastern european city with somewhere 280k ppl, and its metropolitan area somewhere around 450k.

Not a really big city but not with a negligible number of people.

Here, if you throw your cigarette filter (after you smoked) on the street from your car, there is a good change you'll be posted and shamed onto the local traffic facebook group.

Also, if you dare to throw away on streets something like your chips bag after you eat your chips, you'll get a judging look by all the ppl around you and if you don't look scary there is a good change somebody will approach you and ask ""why you throw garbage on street""

So, why is there so much street garbage on these italian cities?

Does the average italian throw garbage on street?

Does the tourists don't give a sht about a place they don't live in?

Does some expats don't realize it is not good to not throw garbage on street? (without any mean to be racist!! but there may be people who really don't realize that they are doing bad by throwing garbage on street. They just grow up in an environment where this was the norm so it is understandable if they may think it is ok to throw it on street)

ItalyTravel,"Greetings All!  
I just got back from our trip to Italy.  In preparation for our travel, I absorbed all of the subreddits here and I was a little overwhelmed.  The reddits painted a portrait of a crime-ridden experience in which I would be pick pocketed at every corner.  I prepared by buying lots of shorts with zipper pockets.

My trip had us land in Rome and then we rented a car and drove to Tuscany, Pisa, Florence, Bologna and then Milan.

We arrived in Rome a day late because United cancelled our initial flight out of EWR.  We got there a day late, but it seemed that a day less in Rome was actually okay.  WE loved seeing the sights but everything was so crowded, which was fine and expected.

On the first day, we saw the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps.  On the second day, we had a tour of the Colosseum and the Roman Forum.  We booked with Get Your Guide and all was fine.  I would have liked to see more of Parliament Hill though as the tour didn't go up. We then took the metro towards the Vatican.  This was our only instance of a alleged pickpocket.  As we were getting on the subway in the Termini station, and as the doors were closing a group of 19-20ish year old individuals came rushing onto the train.  One guy stood in front of me staring at my pockets, but i had my hands on my valuables in my zip pockets.  They got off at the next station without incident.

We saw the Vatican and checked out a skip the line tour of St. Peter's Cathedral.  It was pretty much no skipping the line, so we spent 45 minutes on line to get in and ditched the tour.

We left Rome and driving in the cities were crazy, but fine.  We went up to Barone-Riscoli Vineyard and it was beautiful.  We then drove to Pisa and it was awesome, but needed no more than an hour.  We had dinner at Tre Pini outside of Florence and it was spectacular.

Florence was our favorite.  We also saw the start of the Tour de France, which was epic.  The Basillica was awesome and we stayed at the Plaza Lucchesi which had a rooftop bar which was spectacular at sunset.

We then headed to Bologna.  It was okay, but we saw another stage of the Tour de France with VIP seating and that was awesome.

Our last stop was Milan.  The Basilica was beautiful, La Scala was spectacular and the tour was super informative and Sforza Castle was pretty cool.  We also really liked the Super Starbucks there as well.  The overall vibe of Milan was one huge shopping mall.

A couple of other hints that I was curious about: We didn't really need to walk around with our passports.  We kept a photo on our phone and the two times they were asked for, the phone photos were enough.  Also, I wore pants on our trip to the Pantheon.  It was really hot.  After that, I did not get any hassle for shorts in any church including the Vatican, the Basillica in Florence, and the Cathedral in Milan.  They were about 2"" above my knee and all was good.  I did see the guards giving more concern to women with open back and revealing shirts more than their attention to shorts. 

Every meal was awesome except for one and this was a once in a lifetime trip.  We didn't see the amount of crime that was advertised and I mentioned to my wife that out of every 1000 people who had a great trip, the people who are more likely to post are the ones that had a bad experience.  Have a great trip!",t2_gl9p8oc4,Italy was awesome-I just got back and here is my take,0.93,231,1720570855.0,1720570855.0,118,aveiss,1dzi28p
ItalyTravel,"Just got back from a week in Italy, and wanted to report back about something that happened to my boyfriend and I as a word of warning to any Americans (or other non-EU citizens) with trips planned.

We were in central Florence in a well populated area (one of the main church squares) at \~8:30PM walking home from dinner when were were pulled over by a police car (as pedestrians). They demanded to know where we were from; when we said the US, they demanded to see our passports. I always keep my passport in the hotel safe (so it's less likely to be lost/stolen) and we explained it was back there (a 10 minute walk away). They were not happy and proceeded to essentially scold/yell at us for several minutes insisting that we must have it on our person, asking us a million questions, and no, a photo was not good enough, because they specifically need to check the Schengen entry stamp to make sure more than 90 days has not passed. We were cooperative and pleaded (genuine) ignorance, but they made us sit there for a tense few minutes after scolding us while chatting to themselves in Italian (and reviewing our drivers' licenses, the only ID we did have). For a time it almost seemed as if they were going to drive us to our hotel because they kept asking about the location, or follow us there on foot. It was very unnerving & stressful.

Thankfully, they ultimately let us off (with a stern warning); my initial reaction was they were potentially trying to get money out of us. However, upon returning to the hotel and doing research, it appears that it is in fact that law in Italy that any non-Schengen passport holder must carry their actual passport with them at all times in Italy and that cops can question anyone, without cause, to see their ID. Italians/Europeans also are required by law to carry ID at all times, though it doesn't have to be a passport. I had no idea, and have never heard of this in the US or any other countries, so wanted to warn people here.

The penalties for not doing this (even if later on you can produce a valid passport that shows you haven't overstayed your welcome) are either a 2,000 euro fine, or up to one year in prison. Upon researching, enforcement of this law seems exceedingly rare, so your odds of this happening to you (and then not being lucky to get off with a warning like we were) probably are very, very low. However, it's worth considering given your risk tolerance. I talked to an Italian friend, and with the right-wing/anti-immigrant government in charge there now, they (though not aware of this law either) believe it may become more common than it has been in the past for tourists to be questioned like this.

And to be clear, we were literally doing NOTHING to draw attention to ourselves (not drunk, no PDA, not wearing anything abnormal, no loud talking/stumbling, not loitering near private residences, etc.) just quietly walking & chatting in English.

ItalyTravel,"Greetings all,

My wife and I just visited Italy for 3 weeks, spreading our time between Venice, Lake Como, Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples. I thought I'd comment on a few things I observed during my time here, which may hopefully be of use to those planning their own trip:

1) The Italian people are very friendly, and I found everyone to be quite kind and helpful. There's a ton of doom & gloom posting on here about pickpockets and other dangers, but to be honest it's either unfounded or we were lucky enough not to experience anything of the sort. We travelled with our valuables in cross-body bags, and did not feel threatened or in danger whatsoever, in train stations or walking around Milan and Rome at night. I'm not saying that you should disregard all security precautions; if you're in big cities, take the normal steps to ensure your safety, but Italian cities don't seem any different to me than other major European cities. I would go as far as to say that we felt safer in Italy than we typically do on a night out back home.


2) Overall, public transportation was great and the high-speed trains in particular were amazing! This is by far the best way to travel between major cities quickly and efficiently. For the first week, we rented a car and drove across northern Italy, and that was a fun experience. That being said, the further south you go, the more congested it is and the driving/parking gets steadily crazier. I was glad to not have a car when in Florence, Rome and Naples. Most cities are walkable, and buses/trains can assist on day-trips. We left Milan by train to watch a Serie A game in Monza, and it was awesome! One thing to note: in the train stations and airports, it is not uncommon for information regarding your travel to be released last-minute. In the train stations, the departure platform for our trains weren't announced until 5 minutes before the train was scheduled to leave, and in the airports the gate for our flights were only indicated an hour before departure. If this happens to you, don't freak out! ""Italian-time"" is a very real phenomenon, just chill and go with the flow.


3) There's a ton of fun things to do that don't require pre-purchased tickets, but if you're hoping to see the popular/major attractions, (i.e. Colosseum, St. Peters,  Pompeii, climb Mt. Vesuvius, etc.) pre-bought tickets are a must. For some things, like Vesuvius, tickets are sold out months before, so if you just show up hoping to get in you will be quite disappointed. For others, like Vatican City or Caesar's Forum you can show up and purchase a ticket that day, but you will likely be waiting in a massive queue for several hours. Buying tickets in advance will save you alot of trouble. If you were unable to buy tickets independently, you can book a guided-tour with a third-party company like Viator or GetYourGuide as they have a number of tickets pre-bought for each outting/attraction. 


4) The best restaurants to eat at are the holes-in-wall, without any flashy signage or people out front attempting to convince you to enter. Research what locals typically eat and check the menu's to see if the place is authentic. For example, if you're in Rome and you see Trippa alla romana on the menu, that's probably a good indicator that the restaurant mostly caters to locals and the food will be good. Bad restaurants only survive in tourist hotspots, but if the establishment is located where locals live it has to be good or it wouldn't survive. Italians are very passionate about good quality food, and I will dearly miss the pasta, wine, and cheese. Be bold, step out of your comfort zone and try new things! You won't regret it.


5) A quick note regarding the weather. Travelling in the off-season means you are likely going to encounter rain. It was raining for about half of our trip, but it didn't stop us from having a great time. You might think: ""Darn, rain. Bad day to go out and see things"", but you'd be wrong! That is actually the best time to go out and see things, as 75% of the tourist hordes will be hiding away, and the queues for major attractions that are typically hours long will be remarkably short, if there is even a queue at all. Bring a windbreaker, buy an umbrella, and continue your adventure!


In conclusion, we had a wonderful time in Italy, and I would certainly come back again. The country is absolutely overflowing with nautral beauty, stunning architecture, amazing art, and incredible food/wine. I love the laid-back attitude and work/life balance most Italians have, and I'm going to try my best to bring a slice of that home with me. I hope this post was of some use, and that you enjoy your time in this wonderful country. Ciao!

Flew in to Milan, got off the plane and realized small bag containing passport was forgoten under plane seat. Immediately notified border police before even entering airport from tarmac. 

Police search plane and ask flight crew but no luck, apperantly. Called embassy in Milan but unable to help since I can't leave airport, need to be in person appointment for emergency passport.  
Police don't want to help at all, proceed to be quite prejudice but not the focus of the post, insist no option but to remain at airport. Showed them copy of passport and other IDs as well.

Spent the night in holding cell and deported on the next available flight back. Morning of flight out I get a notification that bag was found on the plane, crew member mentioned trying to give it to Police but police insisted it's wrong bag despite containing a passport. Deported to country of connecting flight, who let me in after hearing my story and seeing copy of passport. 🤷‍♂️

1st and most obvious: your passport is part of your soul when traveling, completely my fault for forgetting. 

2nd: if you know you lost something try and ask the police to escort you to search yourself if possible, whether on the plane or airport bus etc. 

3rd: always have multiple copies of passport/ID with you, multiple benefits here but it allowed me to get an official police report which helped significantly with insurance claims, customs explanations, refunds etc. - Also satisfies the identification requirement for an emergency passport, should they let you get to the embassy. 

4th: should you still get deported to a country other than your home, emergency passport appointments are typically easy to schedule at your closest embassy. Even if it says they are booked up, they will make accommodations to see you asap, just contact them and explain your situation. - try and get a print copy of a confirmation of this appointment to show customs officers, this along with a copy of your passport should help you get to the embassy at least.

ItalyTravel,"Edit; thank you for 24+ hours of both hilariously rude and very genuine responses! yes, I am in fact traveling to Italy with the sole intention of trying gelato! and yes, I am a horribly stressful person to be around! 


I have some questions about gelato and finding the best gelaterias. In the many many months of research I did before coming, I always read that the best real gelato would be served in metal containers, and many people said to look for metal lids that would keep the gelato fresh. Every post said to avoid mounds and bright colors. But I’ve been in Venice, Milan, and now Florence and I’m having a really hard time finding these supposed gelaterias… we will search high and low for the best reviewed places only to walk in and their mint to be green and while we have avoided the obviously outrageous mounds piled high, most do seem to be whipped at least as high as the container if not several inches above. 

I’m at the point where I can’t convince my group that we should keep looking for more authentic quality places, because they have loved each place we’ve been to.

ItalyTravel,"Italian here, lazy/boring summer afternoon at work.

I love to travel, both in the world (50+ countries visited) & in my country (nearly all regions, 100+ places visited).  
I try to help sometimes here in the sub, especially trying to save tourists from Romeflorencevenicein7days itineraries (often failing). But Italy is so much more, Italy needs time.

From my experience, Tier 1 (famous areas, of course for a reason) locations for tourists in Italy are more or less: Rome, Venice, Florence (& famous Tuscany towns like Pisa, Lucca, Siena, San Gimignano), Milan, Bologna, Verona, Naples, Pompeii & more ""nature"" attractions like Cinque Terre, Amalfi Coast & Capri, Lake Como, Lake Garda, Dolomites, Alps, Sardinia for beaches. But, again, Italy is so much more, Italy needs time.

I offer an AMA to the most curious & adventurous of you, if you have any questions or requesting specific suggestions (which one is the best for X, how can I add X to my itinerary, what did you liked in X, local-food-to-try in X..) about these 20 underrated but AMAZING italian cities/towns that I suggest you to inform about and absolutely to go to!

* North: Padova/Padua, Merano, Mantova/Mantua
* Emilia-Romagna: Ferrara (most underrated city of all imho), Parma, Ravenna, Modena
* Marche: Urbino, Gradara
* Tuscany: Pitigliano, Cortona (both more remote so a bit forgotten)
* Umbria (most underrated region of all imho): Assisi, Gubbio, Spello, Orvieto
* South: Matera, Lecce, Ostuni
* Sicily: Ragusa, Siracusa

Anyone who wants to share an experience in these places or add other italian places that are underrated in his/her opinion is welcome! Enjoy!",t2_o8sm4n2p,Top 20 underrated italian cities/towns > AMA,0.95,188,1722426155.0,1722426155.0,196,Aggressive_Owl4802,1egl0ys
ItalyTravel,"*edit:I love how some people don’t make any mistakes. I’m sure they’ve never fallen off their bike when they were just learning, they’ve never locked themselves out of their hotel room, they’ve never burnt anything in the oven because they forgot, and they’ve never gone to the store just to find only rock hard avocados when they needed ripe ones right away🙄 

I understand some people would bash me no matter what our circumstances were, but here’s why I didn’t do any research. 

When we originally started planning this trip to Europe for 2 weeks, we agreed to let each other choose a few regions/cities to go together- I chose  Paris and Puglia. MIL chose Venice. Venice actually never appealed to me although I’m enjoying every second of it now that I’m here.

I figured I’d let her research for Venice since it was her pick. When we were on the plane to Venice, she couldn’t tell me a single thing she wanted us to do in Venice. I think she purposely decided not to do any research because she really can’t walk that much in her condition. So she didn’t want to find out what was coming her way. I’m not saying I shouldn’t be held accountable, but at least I know I’m not the one who put her through this misery that’ll be over soon.


Hi, all! We did zero research before coming to Venice yesterday, which means we had no idea how many freaking steps and bridges there were. Our Airbnb was a 20-min walk from the stop we got dropped off at. We, like idiots, decided to drag this suitcase that had all of our stuff in and a carseat for our toddler that was useless on the island all the freaking way to our Airbnb. And to make it even worse, we had a stroller with our child in and his grandma who has walking issues.
Needless to say, it was painful although a lot of people helped us go over the bridges. ( It was still nice to be reminded that humanity isn’t dead despite how miserable we were)

Maybe some of you are smart enough to have learned this already, but if you aren’t one of those people? Please learn from our mistake.

Grab a weekender bag(backpack) and fill it up with only what you’ll need for your stay on Venice. As for the rest of your stuff, rent a locker and leave it behind there!

ItalyTravel,"Had dinner in the Navigili area around 8pm and headed to the metro station to go back home. As I was walking down the last block before the station, a group of men were crowding the sidewalk, reacting to something on one of their phones. They were shouting and sounding surprised. I am very naive and thought nothing of this. During all this, another guy who was walking next to me also seemed distracted by it, then suddenly took a 90 degree turn and ran right into me. I gave the benefit of the doubt and just said sorry. He said “excuse you” in Italian and slammed his fist into my chest. I was shocked but just kept walking to avoid the situation. After a few seconds he runs up to my face and starts confronting me for ”bumping into him”. When i finally got out of the situation and made my way to the metro, I realized my glasses in my shirt pocket were gone. Everything clicked at that moment. I don’t even care about losing the glasses. They were expensive but can be replaced when I get home. I am just shocked and honestly saddened that I would get assaulted in the process of a pickpocket attempt in a touristy area. There were plenty of people around so I guess they do a good job of making everything look like an accident. I have spent a month in Spain and several months throughout western and eastern europe.

ItalyTravel,"Before traveling to Italy, I was under the impression that portion sizes are small compared to America. And while that is sometimes true, it's only true compared to the monster portions that SOME American restaraunts serve. 

I visited Florence and Rome for 3 weeks and ate at over 40 different restaraunts and their portions were just as big as portions in the US, specifically New York City restaraunt portions. A plate of Cacio E Pepe was fairly big and eating that alone stuffed me completely that I couldn't even finish it. Then our waiter made a joke thinking I hated it because I couldn't finish it. He said typically Italians eat a second course after. There's no way this plate of pasta had anything less than1500 kcal too...

ItalyTravel,"Wow! I had my rental car window smashed and all bags stolen within 30 minutes of parking at a rental apartment near Rome.  I believe the thieves used air tag scanners and were actively driving around looking for cars in parking lots with air tags and other trackers. Fortunately it was on the last day of our trip. Other than that Italy was wonderful. 

Rome seems to have a serious petty theft problem from my experience and comments from other travelers on my flight home that also mentioned they were targeted by pick pockets.

I filed a report with the police department. Which the police seemed indefirent about.  The crime happened at 5PM.  I waited an hour for the police to arrive after calling...which they never did. I then drove through car to two different police stations. Both times the police told me they were closed for the evening, wouldn't file a report and to return at 8 AM the next day....the problem was my flight departed at 10:30 AM the next morning.

ItalyTravel,"My fiancee and I, along with some of our friends, were traveling around Naples and Rome, and everything we saw online recommended going to Positano -- how it was better than the surrounding islands, it was a must-see. And so I just wanted to put the following out there:

I would recommend not going to Positano unless you (for some reason) cannot go to Capri, Ischia, or Procida, and you've also done literally everything in and around Naples. 

For us, the day we spent there was unambiguously the worst experience we had in our two weeks in Italy. 

There's only so much that a pretty view can do for you when you're stuck in a crowded dense hell of tourists, and where any attempt at escaping the crowds using the roads involves cars, busses, and mopeds whizzing by you with only a foot or two of clearance. 

As soon as we got off the ferry, we all collectively realized what a profound mistake we had made. The roads were jammed with a slow mass of humananity shuffling in unison from horrible trinket shop to horrible trinket shop. Sure, it was in early September, still somewhat travel season, but it was on a WEDNESDAY. 

My fiancee and I had just been to Ischia, our friends had just taken a day trip in Capri, and we were both shocked. Neither island had been remotely as crowded, and both offered so many more interesting things to do. In Positano, the options seemed to be the following: go to the beach (fine, but lots of places offer this) or go to a series of shops where you can buy expensive trinkets to memorialize your worst day in Italy. 

Have you ever wanted a ceramic sea anemone? Neither have I. How about a statuette of a lemon? No? Don't worry though, if nauseatingly tacky ornaments aren't your vibe, you can also purchase a sweat-shop dress for 200 euro! 

Basically, I don't know who this place is for. It feels like a perfect storm of tacky, crowded, and expensive. This is by far the worst kind of tacky. I would much prefer the kind of unpretentious tacky store - the kind that sells green white and red shot glasses shaped like boobs. Those, at least, offer some kind of interesting authenticity. You see the fat guy behind the counter and you can imagine what he was thinking when he placed an order for them. ""These are funny"" you imagine him thinking. And imagining his state of mind itself provides some kind of human experience. 

I'm these stores, you just see ""fancy"" garbage, and feel condescended to. These people know you would never buy a shot glass with boobs on it. They think they know you. ""These idiots"" you imagine these venders saying to each other ""I bet they'll buy this ceramic clock made to look like a lemoncello bottle"". You feel that these people know you just well enough to insult you.

Maybe my tastes are specific though, and maybe the day I visited coincided with some holiday I wasn't aware of -- everybody-go-to-Positano day, for example.

I felt it would be morally wrong of me to not warn others that at a minimum, in early September of 2024, do not go to Positano if you have other options. ",t2_xuxq4,Consider not going to Positano ,0.84,175,1726213947.0,1726213947.0,191,christawful,1ffp9mv

We are in tuscany for context. 
Since we came here the people really stare you down for longer than you’d expect? Men aswell as women. You could just walk pass and they have stared at you the whole time. People have even pointed at us directly when we were just standing doing nothing 😅

ItalyTravel,"Recently did a 2 week, 2 person trip. I used this sub a lot before/during the trip, so I wanted to give back! We started/ended in Rome, with Florence and Venice in between. The big 3. It was spectacular. And everyone we met, both locals and tourists alike, were cool and fun and funny and in great moods and helpful and happy. It’s a country that knows how to do tourism right.

# General things:

**Train**:  
We did Italo train, mainly because I liked their app better for ticket management. For Venice to Rome (our longest one) we did the club class and it was awesome. Free beer and lunch! I also paid for lounge access in each train station, since there were times when hotel checkouts and trains leaving had an extra hour or so of ""emergency buffer time."" The Rome one is beautiful, Venice is fine, Florence is a bit overused. Trains all on time.

**Google Maps:**  
During down times (train rides, etc) I would poke around in this sub, and bookmark places on Google Maps for every city/neighborhood. That way, if I found myself in that neighborhood, looking for a restaurant/story/interesting site, they would all pop up on the map for me. It was especially great for restaurants. Other people on Reddit have posted links to Google Maps for restaurants, so I’m going to do the same *(vs. websites)*.

**Cost:**  
Coming from the US west coast, it was a pleasant surprise how affordable it was to eat and drink in Rome and Florence.  Goods, travel, and lodging are pretty comparable. But we were finding ourselves “going for it” with eating and wine because we were expecting it to be a lot more expensive.

**Money:**  
I got 300 euros cash, and came home with 40. We only used cash in very random places - tipping hotels, small markets, etc. Everywhere is tap to pay from the phone, it was so convenient. You don’t even ever need to pull out your card. I know a lot of people wonder about this.

**Tickets:**  
For each city, we picked a few ""anchor"" things and get them in advance. We spent more for skip the line and timed entries whenever we could. We won't be getting back too soon, so every minute was worth more to us.

# The Cities

*All neighborhoods are approximate. Sorry if I'm wrong.*

**Rome:**  
We went by all the major things and places, but as well documented in this sub, those all get **huge** crowds. This was my first time back to Italy in a couple decades, and it was remarkable how much tourism has grown. For example, I remember the Pantheon being something you just wandered into as you were walking by. But it's all good and deserved and nothing to be scared of, just prepared for. We're all tourists, and we go to tourist things because they are awesome deserve to be seen. And you meet people! And we found it to be ""authentic Italy"" that everyone is worried about. We saw/heard a lot of Italian tourists in Rome, especially school groups. We honestly didn't hear a ton of English during May. If things were too crowded, we just pivoted to the wander/discover options. You can't not find something within 5 minutes of the ""big"" spots.

**Restaurants in Rome:**

* [Antico Arco.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PLmAe4z5Z1zMy2Yw5) Trastevere.  This was the best meal we had in Rome. A bit more modern than traditional, but delicious. Great walk up the hill from Trastevere too.
* [Da Tonino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMTwe4yyrbFtamr5A). Near Piazza Navona. This was a well deserved Reddit rec, the line was too long for most dinners as this is a very crowded tourist street, so we went the next day and had a spectacular lunch.
* [Trieste Pizza.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W628AF6BJnLT8tfUA) Monte. This was another Reddit rec, cute little place with small pizzas. Fun and good for a quick bite while thrifting.
* [Osteria Margotta.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zyAZqovyf7URhh1y9) Near Spanish Steps. This was our last dinner in Italy, on what we thought was one of the prettiest streets in the area. Great way to end the whole thing.
* [I Pizzicaroli.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XRZfFfjiNrNhmudW6) Near Piazza Navona. Great salumi/charcuterie boards in a fun atmosphere.
* [Molly’s Garden.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KLJhPktGbEWCg7R96) Near Piazza Navona. Good for breakfast smoothies
* [Beppe and His Cheeses](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1aEmteKNs7NUxAzb9). Near Ponte Garibaldi. Fun little tasting cheese shop.

**Some things we did in Rome:**

* **Vatican Museum.** Not gonna lie, this was a tough one. We had “skip the line” and an official tour, so getting into the building was pretty fast. I can't imagine not having tickets. But then we started the trudge with 25K of our good friends. It’s so crowded you are always pushed up against a wall and weaving through other people. Every tour group is competing for space, trying to stay together. It is impressive that the walkie-talkie earpieces don’t have any bleed over. But it’s really really crowded, and then you get to the Sistine Chapel, and people are still talking, and you have to compete for a space. I will say for the number of people going through an hour they do a great job managing the crowd.  We didn’t even bother trying to get into St. Peter’s. The line wrapped all the way around the piazza. If this is a bucket list thing for you, I'd seriously think about a non-summer trip so you can have some space.
* **Borghese Gallery and Gardens.** After the morning at the Vatican, this was a literal breath of fresh air. Just walking through the park, the approach, the calm…it was great. We did it at the end of the day, around a 5 o’clock entry? So the crowds were cooling off. And then just wander the trees.
* **Bikes on the Appian Way.** By the end of the trip, we were maxed out on crowds. We hopped the Metro out rent bikes at [BicycleRoma](https://www.bicycleroma.com/en/Bike%20Tours/appia-antica-noleggio-bici/). We got the e-mountain bikes. You have to get those because it’s really bumpy. They load you up with a google map of a self-guided tour and a phone holder, and you can ride the Appian way, then through a few neighborhoods over to another park, where you ride next to the aqueducts, then back to the Appian Way. It was a real treat, and unique, and we loved it. Plus you start and end at a cute cafe for beers and a snack. Highly recommend if you want to get away from the crowds.
* **Monti area shopping.** There are a bunch of stores that have racks and racks of used leather jackets, and they’re generally all around 40 euros. It’s insane, and a great place to get a cool coat for cheap.
* **Forum.** We found the empty entrance on the far end of the park recommended on Reddit, closer to the Capitoline, on the opposite end from the Colosseum entrance. Got the tickets on the official website with phone, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for the online “queue.” Then we did the free Rick Steves audio guide via his app, which is awesome. Love you Rick.

**Florence**  
Florence was crowded too, but it seems like half of the crowd is kids doing study abroad. Some people might not like that, but we thought it  
injected a fun, exciting energy into the town. If I ever go back, I’ll stay over in Santo Spirito, vs. closer to the “big attractions.” There are clubs in Florence that start around 1:00 am, which can get a little noisy haha.

**Restaurants in Florence**

* [Al Tranvai.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bTjSdev6U2PqhmeE7) Santo Spirito. This was a Reddit rec, and possibly my favorite meal of the trip for me. Got the bibbolita and a steak. Cute, quiet(er), super nice staff. It was big highlight of the trip.
* [Momoyama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KqVGF6xxrx2t3Ct17). Santo Spirito. Sushi in Italy? Yes! And it was “Mexican night” and they had sushi tacos with a full mariachi band. Beautiful dining room, great food.
* [Da Nerbone.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qgpfYaQYd8Akqq4L7) In the Market. Famous for a reason. It was great, no doubt. And fun and vibrant. I kind of messed up though by just eating too much here. If I do it again, I will eat a lot more small things from more places in the market. I would also possibly go a bit more off hours, we went right at “tourist lunch” time, which made sitting a little harder.
* [Bistrot Monaconero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mxKiW2BvcW4DAx2w7). Santo Spirito. This place just opened this summer, very cool interior, nice crew running it, great food and drinks. Lots of tartare.
* [Locale.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D79oTGtHZH4NMLGa6) City Center. Super fancy for cocktails. Beautiful interiors.

**Some things we did in Florence**

* **Uffizi Gallery.** We had pre-purchased tickets, 10 am entry. Was expecting big crowds, but we walked right in. I now understand why people say this is one of the greatest in the world, and I wish this was the first museum I’ve ever gone to in my life. Having never been a big museum person, this kind of changed things for me. We did the Rick Steves audio on this too. The way the museum progresses chronologically from pre- to post-Renaissance, while acknowledging the influence of ancient art, is brilliant. Having been to museums all over the world, it unlocked a lot of things in our brains, and I wish I’d gone here before the Vatican Museums. The cafe on the patio is an extra bonus.
* **Boboli and Bardini Gardens, plus Pitti.** Our Uffizi tickets also got us into Boboli and Pitti. Great views from both, peaceful walks, nice to beat the crowds. But lots of uphills, so time it to beat the heat. Pitti was quiet and big, with small crowds in the afternoon. Plus the costume/clothing exhibit is really cool. Good cafe in the courtyard too.
* **Santo Spirito shopping.** This is where we did the most work with our credit cards. Clothes, shoes, fabrics, artisan goods. Plus a market in the piazza on the weekends.
* **Progressive dinner / food tour.** We did a night with [Curious Appetite](https://curiousappetitetravel.com/) off a Reddit rec. It was really fun, great food, and after being 1-1 for a week, it was really fun to talk to other travelers. I’m sold on small tour groups now. We also did a small vespa ride trip too. It was a blast.
* **Lucca.** This was our day trip, direct on the easy train ride. When everyone says *“go ride bikes around the wall,”* they are right. It was delightful, and there’s racks of rentals everywhere. We also ended by trying to ride through town, which is super fun. It’s almost like a video game, trying to navigate the alleys without knowing where you’re going. Ended the day by sitting in the big piazza, watching everyone go through the “flea market.” Everything about the entire day was perfect.
* **Jazz Club** For live music, the club is literally called “Jazz Club. “ Cool room in the basement, good drinks, full of young people digging the music. Jazz is alive in Florence!

**Venice**  
I know a lot of people on this sub say skip Venice, or don’t spend too much time, and I can’t disagree more. I love Venice, it’s not my first time. Yes, the famous sights are insanely crowded. The streets right off those sights are jammed up, and stuffed with the same luxury brands you find at the Venetian in Vegas. But it takes about 60 seconds to get away from that, even in the height of tourist season. There’s just so many more places to wander, and get lost, and all of the charm that makes Venice what it is. And we didn’t even get out to the islands.

Venice is and isn't dying. It’s quieter for sure. But it is alive with new art. It feels like around every corner you stumble on a gallery or exhibit or museum, particularly during the Biennale.

**Some things we did in Venice:**

* **The Biennale**. This goes before restaurants. I knew about it, but didn’t really know what to expect. And it’s amazing, and exciting, and vibrant. We didn’t intentionally go this year because of it, but I feel so lucky we did. For 40 euros you can spend days looking at art from all over the world. And it's not just paintings and statues - it's installations, and films, and lights, and sound, and water and...It's just a trip. After a week and a half of a lot of pictures of Mary, it was exciting to see new art, and what's happening **right now**. All the cruise ship people were in line for the Doge’s Palace, and that’s great for them. But I don’t think any of them really know what’s going on right down the island. A world fair for art. And we weren’t even there for film or music, which must be even more alive. Two full days wasn’t enough.
* **The other exhibits.** There’s free Biennale country exhibits all over town, and then special installations in some of the other museums. We went to Liminal at Palazzo Grassi. Just the walk there is spectacular. And then the installation is out of this world. Walking around in the dark, films, senses, lights, sounds…it was a blast. [https://www.pinaultcollection.com/palazzograssi/en/pierre-huyghe-liminal](https://www.pinaultcollection.com/palazzograssi/en/pierre-huyghe-liminal)
* **Getting lost**. Obviously. That’s why you go.

**Restaurants in Venice**

* [Frary’s](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wmb8b3ma9hDb11FS6). San Polo. Delicious Mediterranean.
* [Osteria Ae Saracche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4U4vzUJ9oLLLqgZ89). San Polo. Cool little bistro on a quieter canal. Great staff, vibrant, delicious.
* [Anywhere on Campo Santo Stefano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HPkNFccohDPNe4xbA). We spent a few hours hopping places here. What I love about Venice is the piazzas are (obviously) car and scooter free. So there’s more human action in them, which makes for even better people watching. Kids chase pigeons, people stop and talk, and no one is dodging trucks and taxis. This one is great because people are walking through to the Accademia. We had a lot of Aperols in this piazza watching the parade.",t2_3fzr4jei,Trip Report - Rome/Florence/Venice in May,0.99,178,1717269629.0,1717269629.0,54,redcurtainrod,1d5uky5
ItalyTravel,"TLDR: G7 and elections in Italy next week leading to more security checks, carry your id and be patient with authorities.

Tons of comments from travelers about id/passport checks.

First: yes, the police and military do have a right to ask you to identify yourself and for non-Italian citizens/residents, this includes providing national id/passport.

Yes, this means you're supposed to carry your passport with you at all times. If you don't have it with you, you can be arrested or fined, but most likely they will want to accompany you to your passport (aka to your hotel).

Second: no you have not been racially/ethnically/religiously/etc/etc targeted. They are checking everyone crossing the border, everyone in major train stations and everyone around major tourist sites. Checks are especially stringent in Puglia near the G7 site. There are really only a few guaranteed ways to not be asked- be pregnant, have a child under 2 with you or be walking your dog. Do any of those 3 excpetions apply to you? No, then you're likely going to be checked.

That being said, the controls  ARE higher than usual. And starting tomorrow, Italy is reinstituting passport border controls for those entering Italy from other Schengen countries via air, train, boat, car, etc.

Why?

EU elections are next week and so is the G7. 

Police are on heightened alert due to increased security risks meant to disrupt the elections and the conference. 

What does this mean for you?

Carry your passport/national id, be prepared to present it upon request and understand that this is part of larger anti-terrorist efforst in the lead up to the G7 conference and the election. If you're going to be in Puglia, expect traffic, road closures, re-routings and places around Fasano to be closed or have limited access.

ItalyTravel,"I’m just an average American who recently returned from 2 weeks in Italy. I had a great time experiencing the culture, food, and history.

I enjoy a good cup of coffee. At home I use the DeLonghi Eletta Explore with Illy coffee beans and I’ve been quite happy. During my travels in Italy, I got used to a good morning cappuccino (or 3) and afternoon espresso or an affogato after dinner. 

Heres my dilemma… since I got home a few days ago, I can’t stomach my coffee! I just need Italian coffee back in my life. Is it the beans? The coffee maker? I don’t know.

ItalyTravel,"We just got back from a 12 day trip to Italy, a return trip for me but it was new for my two kids. We were in Venice, Cinque Terre, Florence, a small town in Tuscany, and Bologna, with one day in Milan. 

First - there are TOO MANY tourists in Italy, and I realize we were part of the problem. It is so, so crowded some spots it feels like the original culture/spirit of the place is disappearing. This is something I will really consider going forward - how much I want to contribute to this issue? I would also recommend staying in areas further from the tourist zones, going at a different time of the year, etc. 

A few general thoughts: 

Enjoy cafe culture in Italy! The morning ritual of getting a cafe, a cappuccino and a little pastry is wonderful. It is something you do standing at the bar, or sitting at a table. It is not something you take away and eat on the go - enjoy it there, on the spot.

Eat in restaurants that are a little further from the tourist areas. Do some research in Italian with translation if you need it to find good reviews. There is no need to go to super fancy spots, you will eat well. 

We took trains everywhere, and they were great. The platform number doesn't appear on the signs often til 15 or even 10 minutes before. So you really don't need to arrive at a station much before that. Sometimes trains were late, which means we missed connections. It was fine - we just caught the next train. Some cities have more than one train station, so make sure you know which one your train is at!

Try to learn a little Italian - it goes a long way. People were very kind and helped us out, but showing you were attempting to speak Italian was helpful. 



Venice

-We stayed on Giudecca, which was great. A bit away from the crowds, and much calmer. 

-Get a pass for the vaporetto (water bus) system. It was great to explore further and to see the city from the water without paying for private boats. Tip: It can be tricky to figure out which dock has your boat, so plan for some time to figure this out. Also, try to go to the back deck of the boats - people stay in the front (open area) or the covered seating area, but the back deck was less crowded, and a beautiful place to view the city.

-We went to the Lido by vaporetto. Great afternoon of swimming in a beautiful ocean. You need to walk a ways down the beach to find the free section, but it was a great walk with our feet in the water. 

Cinque Terre

-We stayed in Vernazza, which we decided was indeed the best of the small towns to stay in. It was busy, but it was a little more ""chill"" than the others that we visited. It had more of a family vibe. 

-Hike in the morning when it is cooler. Do not do this mid-day, it is incredibly hot. Bring lots of water, and wear real shoes. Don't underestimate the up and down nature of the hiking - we saw some people really struggling. It is indeed worth hiking, but just be prepared. 

-We did not eat in a lot of restaurants here because it was almost exclusively focused on tourists. We brought some food with us, as the grocery stores are basically tiny corner stores. We also really enjoyed the focaccia in Vernazza, and the panini in Monterosso at ""Fast Bar"" were excellent. 

Florence

-We had the best granite in Florence, at Carabe. Granite is underrated, I think. We had great gelato all over the place, but granite is especially refreshing and much lighter if you want something sweet but not filling. 

Tuscany

-We stayed at a small hotel in Impruneta, which was lovely. It was a great way to slow down for a few days and enjoy the countryside that is so spectacular. 

-We rented e-bikes for half a day and this was one of the highlights of the trip. Well worth it if you want to see the beautiful roads and don't want to drive. 

Bologna

-Bologna is my favourite city, because it is a walkable, more ""real"" city than the others that we visited. There were still tourists, but it did not feel overrun. We spent two full days here, wandering around, eating the best food of the trip (try some of the Osterie) and shopped as well.

-Check out the big markets held in the piazza on Saturdays. That was really fun and different.

Hope everyone has a safe fun trip, and doesnt have to face this issue.

Hi Everyone,

Our family just got pickpocketed in Rome. We were getting on the metro and a crowd of 5/6 people suddenly came rushing along us. they pushed us around and pickpocketed us while one member kept the gate open so they could escape. Luckily we noticed, yelled, panicked midway so they threw out wallet and phone back on the ground. However they did manage to take all the cash.

It was a sudden confusing experience. They targeted our wallets and phones that were in our front pockets. When we went to report to the police there were a line of 4 families, all who had faced the same situation: phones or wallets pickpocketed in the metro.


Edit:

Thank you everyone for the well wishes and advice. Already using fanny packs and being extra wary.

ItalyTravel,"First visit to Italy and did the ""standard tourist"" circuit: Rome, Florence, Cinque Terre, Venice, Padova, Lake Como, and Milan. Observations:

1. Italians are the most forgiving people in the world. We saw this again and again. 

* We came across a restaurant in Rome with a long line for lunch. We got in line and the manager came to us and explained that we were the last people that would be admitted before break between lunch and dinner. At least 3 separate parties were subsequently allowed in after only minor pleading.
* We repeatedly saw cashiers forgive a Euro or two in a bill when people didn't have change or were a little light.
* We saw a family that showed up to the Milan Duomo with tickets for the following day. They were crestfallen and the ticket counter allowed them in regardless.
* We left our binoculars in the Sistine Chapel and didn't realize it until we passed the exit. We turned around after the exit to go back and the guard told us no. We explained we forgot our binoculars and he waived us through (and we found our binoculars!)

1. We never felt unsafe, nothing was stolen, and our hotel contacted us to let us know we'd left a stack of USD and Euros, along with several credit cards, in the room after we checked out. After reading some of the posts here, we were mildly panicked that we would be pickpocketed on every street corner and that our bags would be stolen in front of us on the trains.
2. We made some stupid dining decisions. We made too many reservations in advance rather than being spontaneous, and we ate in the same price range every night rather than mixing it up between fancy and cheap meals. We felt like we lost out on the dining experience as a result.
3. The tourist ticketing system at most venues is broken, and the guided tour groups are a menace. We employed every trick in the book to secure Colosseum tickets, but it was simply impossible. The tickets vanished before we could even put them in our cart, apparently snatched up by guided tour bots. We were fortunately able to secure a private tour with a private guide and were happy we did. But we literally spent the entire tour threading the needle between large tour groups. And we saw these groups throughout Italy and they impacted our enjoyment of almost every site we visited. It is disappointing that the ticketing system is so biased towards large tour groups and that one is effectively forced into an organized tour for many venues.
4. By the time Rick Steves writes about it, it's over. We relied \[too\] heavily on Rick Steves' guidebook. We wound up at \[mostly\] mediocre restaurants, places overrun by American tourists, and an atmosphere that seemed scripted for tourism rather than an ""authentic"" experience. Our single worst meal was a Rick Steves recommendation. Our best experiences were our spontaneous ones.
5. Walking two or three blocks from a busy tourist area is all it takes to find a more ""authentic"" experience. This was consistently true throughout Italy. St Mark's Square in Venice? An absolute scrum of tourists. But walk five minutes and you find yourself in a sleepy residential neighborhood.
6. This one may be controversial, but how can a country that makes such amazing pasta produce such lousy bread? Granted, we only tried the bread provided as part of coperto, but it was uniformly terrible.
7. Italy is much more casual than we expected. The item I regret packing most was a travel sports jacket. I wore it once and felt overdressed, even at a nice restaurant.

ItalyTravel,"Ciao - landed in Rome a couple of days ago and after spending countless hours on this sub,  asking for input and guidance, I wanted to pay it back with some real time observations. 

1. The pick pocket hysteria seems to be blown way out of proportion. We visited all the main touristy places and not once did I feel like I was in any kind of precarious situation. Like man yh others have said, be aware of your surroundings, and you'll be fine. 

2. Uber is 100% available and sometimes is a better option than cabs even if at a bit of a premium. We had dinner at a couple of restaurants that weren't in highly trafficed areas and we're able to grab an Uber for $15. We found this more convenient than waiting around for a cab. 

3. Speaking of cabs, make sure they turn on the meter, or they will try and charge you an arbitrary amount and trust me, it won't be to your benefit. 

4. Book all of your tours in advance. I mean ALL of them. The lines I saw for the Vatican and Colosseum for folks to buy tickets was insane. Looked you'd spend half your life there just waiting in line. 

5. If you are claustrophobic or feel uncomfortable around crowds, think twice about the Vatican. It's an absolute zoo with wall to wall people...at least it was that way at 9am. My wife was not a fan and we needed to grab some air for her to gather herself. 

I think that's all I got for now. Onto Montepulciano. 

Ciao!

UPDATE - Thought of some more

6. The water in Rome tastes amazing. Drink from the tap or the numerous public fountains found throughout the city. Added bonus, the water is ice cold. I brought a water bottle from home, but haven't used it yet. 

7. The food here is amazing. Still, some are better than others. I'm sure there will be differing opinions but here are some great spots I absolutely loved:
- Mordi - Amazing small sandwich shop about a 10 min walk from the Vatican. Menu was extensive and sandwiches were delicious. 
- Love Croissants -had breakfast here prior to visiting the Vatican. This place is a coffee nerd's dream(not me) but they offer a wide variety of coffees and take coffee seriously. Had a great flat white here. Also, the offer up tremendous pastries that range from sweet to savory. 
- Nuova Piazetta - Great spot near Colosseum offering up your traditional Roman fare. Their Carbonara was outstanding and my wife thought the Amitriciana pizza was one of the best pizzas she's ever had. Expect a line to get in, but the wait went by quickly. I think we didn't wait more than 10 min. ",t2_86h4pljz,Days 1-2 Live Report: Things I've learned in Rome,0.95,167,1711059317.0,1711059317.0,77,Hoppy_Smoker,1bkj6e0
ItalyTravel,"Look - I love bidets. Nothing is better than a warm splash cleaning up my ass. If you don’t like bidets it’s because you haven’t used a good one. 

Anyway - I was stoked to learn that everywhere I was staying in Italy has bidets. I thought to myself “What a civilized place”. 

Fast forward to the first hotel and I see the bidet. It literally looks like a foot sink. A basin with a plug and faucet pointing down into the basin. I thought to myself “What the hell is this?” No way to spray my ass. I just assumed maybe it was a weird bidet. 

Get to the second hotel. Same damn thing. At this point I’m befuddled. How the hell do I use this thing?! I consulted the interwebs and apparently they use “classic” bidets? Like you are supposed to thoroughly wipe with TP then fill the bidet up with water and wash your ass like you’re in a tub? A tub mind you that you really can’t get your ass into. You’d have to splash the water up with your hand.

ItalyTravel,"I absolutely loved Florence. I found the city incredibly walkable and places of interest seemed to be always a 10-15 min walk (with a few exceptions). 

* Definitely prebook your tickets to the Accademia and the Ufizzi gallery ahead of time. Book right on the website. It's cheaper than the ""skip the line"" tours you see on all the tour sites. Also, you can do them both in the same day...and download the Rick Steves audio tour for both museums. We shared an ear piece and listened together
* I found the cabs in Florence to be much friendlier and honest than in Rome. Just an observation
* The wine windows are cool...but over priced and overrated IMO. But check one out and judge for yourself
* Cross the Ponte Vecchio and dedicate some time to explore the area. We found some great spots there...including Archea Brewery for the beer fans out there. 
* Avoid Florence airport. Supposedly, the runway is short making this airport susceptible to delays if there's inclement weather. Our outbound flight to the states was cancelled bc no plane was able to land past 11:30 am due to winds. ALL flights were diverted to Pisa...not a fun day. 

Onto food and drink...

* You have to try Trippa Florentina. Yes it's tripe...yes it's cow's stomach, but let me tell you it's great. Bambi Trippa Lampredotto in the Mercato Central makes a great sandwich....as does Panino Mondiale by the train station. But by far the best I had was at **Vini e Vecchi Sapori**. This might have been my favorite restaurant we dined at in Florence
* Antica Porchetteria Granieri 1916 - great porchetta sandwich. get the one with truffle cream
* Mercato Centrale - great food hall and market. spend some time wandering and just eat stuff!
* Trattoria Sabatino - this is a Florence institution and has been around 1956. Nothing on the menu was over 7 Euros. Food was great. They open at 7:15 for dinner and expect a line. We got there around 6:45 and were the 5th party in line. 
* Trattoria da i Bigi e i Birghe - went here for Bistecca Florentina. Solid meal. FYI - this style of steak is cooked pretty darn rare. 

One last honorable mention...if you ladies are looking for shoes, check out Calzature Gilardini. My wife picked up three pairs.

ItalyTravel,"Some cities are better than others, Florence was the best, imo, but it’s overall great!

Every hotel that has breakfast HAD gluten free options that were packaged and handed directly to you when you asked. Not all restaurants have options but I stuck with the FindMeGF app and was good. I consider the app for Italians but I didn’t want to pay. I also found gf options are significantly cheaper and you don’t have to pay extra at restaurants. 

*Side Note: You also don’t need a Celiac travel card. I type into Google translate that I had Celiac or just told them (if they spoke English) and they take it seriously!*

Florence has the most options and there are so many dedicated bakeries. I highly recommend you try the McDonald’s Gluten Free hamburger because (while a little strange), it was a nice change. You will also find you can find fluffy wood fired pizza (which made me so happy) that’s actually filling. 

I lost 3 pounds in 2 weeks and ate like a human trash compactor. I was walking more but I also found the food didn’t mess with my stomach like it does in the states. Try the digestive cookies!! 

When you come back, there is a store that delivers to the US. It’s a little pricey on shipping but I found that it’s still overall cheaper plus you get more options. *This is not sponsored but something that I am thankful I found!* The store is Naturitas. I’m back to eating Schar foods produced in Italy (now that I’m back home) and am feeling back to how I felt while traveling. 

Editing with recommendations below. Not all of them but a few highlights: 

Rome:

- GROM: They have gelato with all gluten free flavors and cones

Florence:

- La Loggia Del Piazzale: This one had less options but was nice overall
- Bottega Artigiana Del Gusto: GO HERE! I spent €19.20 on 8 items and one was a focaccia sandwich. It was all amazing!! ⭐️ 

Siena:

- Pizzeria Ristorante di Nonno Mede: It’s a hike but I had amazing wood fired pizza and wine with a fantastic view ⭐️

Ercolano: 

- Burger VIP: Great burger and they had gluten free deserts 

Amalfi:

- Ristorante Pizzeria S. Andrea: BEST gluten free pizza and were great with my nephew (2) ⭐️

- La Cambusa: Great gluten free pasta 
- La Gelateria Della Buca di Bacco: Great gelato

ItalyTravel,"This is my first visit to Italy and I’m travelling alone. Edit: I’m from Malaysia

I put my luggage in the compartment below the bus like everyone else. There were less than 8 luggages in the compartment (I was the last person to put in the luggage before the shuttle took off at 9.25pm or so). The shuttle was quite packed so I had to sit at the back of the shuttle.

We got to Roma Termini about 10pm and because I was seated at the back, it took me slightly longer to go down the shuttle (about a minute waiting for other passengers to go down). By the time I got down, my luggage was already gone :( I described my luggage to the driver and he told me someone took off with my dark green luggage (with a Harley’s Davidson sticker) before I got down. I tried to look for it around the terminal but nothing…

Two military police were kind enough to hear me out and escorted me to the terminal police station for a report, but the person there said they are closed for the night as it was already nearing 11pm. So I was advised to go to another station, which I’ll do tomorrow because I’m tired and still processing about all of these.

I really want to believe someone mistakenly took my luggage in the rush, but idk. Luckily I have all my travel documents and bank cards with me in my backpack, so mostly I lost my clothes.

Sorry for the wall of text, I think I just needed to vent.

ItalyTravel,"My story goes like this…our last day of vacation in Rome we were tired of Italian food, so we found an amazing Indian restaurant for lunch. It was fantastic, and very authentic. A few hours later I broke out in horrible hives, an obvious allergic reaction to something I ate ( I assume it was some spice in the Indian food, but I’ll probably never know for sure). Bottom line is ALL the pharmacies were closed and you cannot buy basic meds like Benadryl or Tylenol at a grocery store! I couldn’t find Benadryl anywhere!! With the reaction getting worse, and as a last resort before I went to a hospital, I went back to the hotel and told the front desk what was happening. Luckily the receptionist had a “Benadryl equivalent” in her purse and gave it to me…though this had to be done in secret bc hotels are obviously not allowed to give out medications. I was lucky and very thankful. I took it and this stopped the reaction from progressing. 

I feel so stupid! I’m a doctor and I can’t believe I didn’t bring Benadryl to a foreign country where you eat food cooked with spices your body has never been exposed to. Please don’t forget to pack this important medication! I’m not even prone to allergic reactions, but in retrospect I still feel like I should have known better. 

I recommend taking the basics…Tylenol, Advil, BENADRYL, Dramamine (if you’re planning to do any boat travel), OTC cold medication, and of course any prescription medication you think you even “might” need. In Italy, you cannot simply walk into a grocery store and purchase these basic meds. They are ONLY sold at pharmacies and most are closed by 8pm.

ItalyTravel,"This morning when taking the train from milan centrale to Verona, We found our backpack disappeared when we arrive destination. I was just shocked shocked shocked. Before our trip I have learned there are a lot of thieves around Milan centrale, so I carefully choosed a hotel in Brera, and I was super attentive in the metro to centrale. But just cannot imagine my backpack is stolen by thief from just over my head. Also I felt super disappointing when I am refused by police to report the stolen in polizia office in verona train station . I can feel that the police refused because I don’t speak Italian well. Finally I was able to report it in bolzano , but just it. Police told me although they can check the camera but it s hard to get it back as if the thief once run out of their monitor covered area, they will probably stop to search.

Some of my thoughts: 

first I am surprised to know the Italian thieves are so bold and rampant to steal in the overhead rack. I have been living Uk and France over ten years, I know how bad the security situation is there but the Italian thieves is definitely next level. Why there are so many thieves in Italy?

secondly I am surprised to know given thieves are bold and are everywhere, the Italian normal people surprisingly accepted it. Ticket inspectors and police just say “sorry about it , it happens everyday “ also look at this italy travel Reddit, again and again you can see the post of stolen in the train, smash the car in the parking , breaking the window of hotel, and so on. People just say “oh sorry to hear that “ “why aren’t you be careful?”, it’s like to tell a girl being raped” why were you wearing such revealing clothes?”

Thirdly reporting police is not really useful, I don’t expect it’s like in Japan or China. I appreciate the effort the police made for me for finishing the report, but after that what can they do?

Finally I just want to say I feel super frustrating. I like how beautiful the Italy is. I like the culture and art here. To prepare my future trip I even started learning Italian language. There are still many areas in my wish list. Now I m becoming paranoid, can I safely travel in italy? Can I safely take train calmly in Italy? Can I safely rent a car or book a hotel with peace in my mind? I really doubt them.


Edit: hi guys thanks for all your help and replies. To be honest this stolen ruined the rest of my trip. The main reason is my computer and hard disk is in the stolen backpack. Some of data are not backup yet. A lot of important video just gone with wind. I am traumatised now and cannot pull myself from deep self-blame. What if I just keep my eye on my bag? I m now lying down in bed in hotel of dolomiti, staring the ceiling. I feel difficult to walk out of hotel and had no idea if I can still continue to travel. I will have to seek help from psychotherapist.

The lessons for me are such painful, I share them to all readers. 
As others said here never never never move your eye out of your belongings especially when train stops.  Lock it if you can.

ItalyTravel,"Hi guys,

So I feel that this question gets asked quite frequently and having lived in and visited quite a few countries myself with different regulations and rules- I definitely understand some people\`s confusion, especially if it happens to be that it\`s their first time travelling. If I recall correctly, I\`ve seen personally (and answered) at least on 4 different occasions of people asking these types of questions.

Let me give you a rundown... Full disclosure, I\`m a non-Italian citizen running a registered bed and breakfast here as my side hustle, so I\`d like to say I know a thing or two about the broad strokes of the bureaucracy, but obviously Italian citizens who may know better may correct me.

**Question 1:** Is it normal that hosts ask for my passport? Why can\`t my drivers\` license suffice?  
**Answer:** YES, it is absolutely normal. I\`ve heard different reasons as to why this started out in Italy (either due to the concerns of terrorism stemming from the 70s in the ""Years of lead"", to prevention of organized crime) but it is normal for the hosts to ask. Here\`s the important bit: IF you\`re an EU citizen, a regular internal ID is perfectly OK.  Chances are if you're unsure if your document is OK, the host can literally just type it up in the AlloggiatiWeb to check. There's a whole lot of document types, but realistically speaking, the chance of this happening is slim as it's generally wise and... A legal requirement to bring your regular ID and/or passport if you're travelling outside your home country. BUT, if you\`re not an EU citizen (And yes, as of Brexit this includes the Brits as well unless they were already grandfathered in to whichever EU nations they were staying at) ONLY YOUR PASSPORT is the mandatory option.

**Question 2:** What do they do with my passport/ID info? Could there be risks of malicious use?  
**Answer:**  FOR THOSE WHO ARE REGISTERED BED AND BREAKFASTS OR LODGING ENTITIES, they are given three platforms. Two of which are for the sake of registering the guests. There, they are told to fill in the details of the guests\` ID and basic info (Such as DOB, the number of their document, issuing authority, and so on). The two platforms are:

1. The Questura (Central Police HQ of a city) and their alloggiatiweb, which is a web registry where the hosts or establishment registers you by ID: What type of ID you've given them, who you are, type of guest, how many days you are staying (up to 30 days), and so on. This is associated with the State Police.
2. The Ross1000 system: This is where you're logged by municipality's tourism board. It could be run by the province or city, but this is purely for statistics. There you more or less get your details punched in like the alloggiatiweb system, although here the owners of the establishments can opt to use this platform like a managing website for their properties. This is associated with the municipality or the provincial level. The difference here is there's a section (For my city it's marked as ""optional"") to mark the purpose of your travel; be it pleasure, business, natural disaster refugee, etc.

As for the latter, IF the host for whatever reason foolishly or maliciously decide to abuse your personal info, they will be punished to the full extent of local and EU laws regarding privacy. It\`d be an INCREDIBLY dumb thing to do as they\`ll not only lose their ability to operate but face jailtime and fiscal penalties to boot. However if the host or owner for whatever reason threatens you in any way, contact the authorities and keep any relevant messages as evidence. This sort of behavior should not be tolerated.

**Question 3:** What is the tourist tax for? How do we know the hosts aren\`t pocketing them? Why is it always in cash?  
**Answer:** When paying for anything tax related in Italy (to my knowledge for obvious reasons) it HAS to be done in cash, and not in ""credit"". You can\`t even buy a ""marca da bollo"" with cards for this reason (I know because I have to apply for the permesso di soggiorno every year!). There's apparently been a point raised about how nowadays it technically is possible, but there's the matter of commissions (For both the customer and merchant) OR in case the host is not P. IVA registered and does not have a mandatory POS system but this is for bed and breakfasts only. Either way, bank transfers are also a valid option.  As mentioned in the previous question/answer, there are three platforms. The THIRD one is called ""GEIS"" (GEstione di Imposta di Soggiorno). This is where the taxes are registered. The host would receive the tax payments, punch in how many nights the guest is staying, and DEPENDING on the city (E.g. Bologna it's 5 nights maximum for every month) there's a threshold on how much maximum you can pay. The cheapest room starts from 4.2 euros a night (up to the room price of 71.99 euros), and the most expensive is 5 euros a night per head (for 121 euros and above per night, if I recall). Either in these flat rates, or 7.5% of the accomodation's price, what type of accommodation is being run (I.e., bed and breakfast/vacation apartment/hotel/agriturismo/etc.), the age of the guests- For instance, children under certain ages are exempt from paying the taxes, and even this depends on a city-by-city basis; also determines the tourist tax rates. At every fiscal quarter the owner would declare how much the tourist taxes the guests paid are, and every year at the end of June a PagoPA bill (One of many types of payment systems for taxes and fines in Italy) gets created and sent by the owner to pay in one go. REMEMBER THAT EVERY CITY HAS DIFFERENT RULES, RATES, AND REGULATIONS ON TOURIST TAXES. Some platforms such as Airbnb may already remit tourist taxes on behalf of the owners. Others, such as Booking, do not. THESE ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE VAT that you may be paying. There are exemption clauses to tourist tax payments but realistically for everyone vacationing here, they would not apply as it's only if the person is in the city for medical reasons, is staying outside of their home cities due to a natural disaster, are a registered student in a university's accommodation, or have already paid their maximum monthly taxable amount for tourist taxes. And even still, there are forms to fill out for the first two, and from my experience not even Italians bother with this form due to how much of a pain in the arse it is.

As for why the tourist taxes exist: They say it's just for the betterment of the city and their respective tourism infrastructure. Whether you agree with it or not- It's the law of the land. Both you and the host may get into trouble if it's unpaid: To the tune of 150 to 5,000 euros PER violation for example in Brescia.

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW whether the owners are paying their tax dues or not (I say do it, because I am sick of the people giving hosts a bad name by doing sketchy crap on the side; like the post from the other day where they offered a traveler a ""cash discount"" and acted angry when they couldn't pay in cash) simply ask if you could have the receipt of the tourist taxes paid. It's literally a matter of going to GEIS, punching in which location (if they happen to be managing many places at once), putting in your name(s), dates of travel, number of people staying and how many nights are taxable. The program literally puts the whole thing together in seconds. If you want a VAT receipt this depends on the type of lodging you're staying, because as bed and breakfasts as of time of writing do NOT require a P.IVA (VAT registration) but they still should be able to give a letter which breaks down how much you've paid, through where, who they are as an entity (usually entailing their own personal information and CIR/registration number for bed and breakfasts) which in my experience sufficed for purposes of bureaucracy. Hotels and vacation apartments obviously should have a P.IVA, so you can ask for a VAT receipt from there, at least. I imagine it's equally easy as punching in the tourist tax details.

GRANTED THOUGH this is for people who are registered owners, private persons running their own commercial activities (Airbnb was specifically mentioned to me by a city hall worker when I was applying) have to find their own ways to navigate through the bureaucracy, but given that at least Airbnb sends in their own VAT and the tourist taxes, you should be good- So long as the hosts there don't ask for extra payments. Then that's a little sus.

**\*\*\*BUT IT BEARS MENTIONING AGAIN THAT: I am a** ***BED AND BREAKFAST***, **not a vacation apartment nor a hotel.\*\*\*** These are possibly subject to different regulations (E.g., the requirement of a P.IVA, the fact that the host must be domiciled or live within 200m of the location, the number of bathrooms both shared and/or private and the ratio with the number of total guests, etc.) so I am speaking BROADLY on these three frequently asked questions. The intricacies may and can very well be different depending on where you're staying, or how you've booked your stay. **I AM NOT A LAWYER, NOR AN ACCOUNTANT, NOR AN EXPERT IN ITALY, NOR A TRAVEL AGENT.** *Please do not solicit me as I'm quite sure even accepting such solicitation requests are against the rules here.* I'm some dude on the internet offering their limited knowledge in a field that they have a decent exposure to, for a rather frequently asked question.

ItalyTravel,"4 of us were in Italy for the last two weeks and arrived into Italy from Switzerland in Bernina Express. Reached Colico in a bus and we had to catch a train to Milan. We had the tickets but they were not validated and it was all very new to us. The train was about to depart and we just got inside the train to keep the luggage so we dont miss the train. I did not want to incur the fines so I decided to make a dash to outside the station to search for the green machine to validate our tickets. In the tunnel connecting the platforms I asked a young guy the whereabouts of this validation machine. The guy saw the urgency I was in and he asked me to follow him, we both ran (me following him) and he took me to the machine and helped me validate the tickets. I was in a lot of hurry to get back into the train and thanked him sincerely. He wished me with 'Have a great trip'.

ItalyTravel,"I recently came back from my trip to Northern Italy and thought I'd share my thoughts and ""culture shocks"" I experienced (I use the term very lightly, however coming from the Baltic region and having been to Rome before I was surprised!)

●Renting a car is SO worth it. A 7 day trip allowed us to visit over 11 cities/towns.

●Driving, on the other hand, is terrifying. I know Northern Italy is considered tame in terms of driving but holy crap was I stressed out. Driving through narrow mountain roads ended up being less stressful than the autostradas!

●Italians absolutely do not care about working hours. We googled and researched 4 or 5 places to eat during our trip that said they were open on Google only to drive down and not find one soul there. Is this a normal occurence or did we just get unlucky?

●I could not get over how dog friendly the country is: immediate mood booster anywhere you go :)

●I can't recommend the Bernina Express enough. As someone who's not extremely fit and kind of intimidated by hiking in the mountains, this was the best way to see them up close.

●We only visited Venice for a few hours but I couldn't shake the feeling that the city is like a movie set that allows tourists in. Most window shutters closed, very few locals.. the beauty was almost overshadowed by the ""ghost town"" feeling, even though it was bustling and full of people.

●Nothing new here, but: search for local restaurants and avoid touristy places. This is why I appreciated renting a car the most: the best eating experience we had was in Pulce, Bolognia. A high rated local restaurant (that had worrying reviews about disliking tourists and not speaking English) ended up being one of the nicest moments of my trip. We didn't speak Italian, our server didn't speak English and yet we communicated, ate delicious food and felt very welcome. Left a 5€ tip (we only spent around 30€ for food) even though I know we weren't supposed to! I just felt so relieved we didn't get the ""google review"" experience that we wanted to express our gratitude somehow. The server ended up catching us out the door and thanking us for two minutes straight (I only caught grazie ragazzi)

●Lake Como and lake Garda were both beautiful but again: I'd recommend staying in a smaller town/village rather than the popular spots. We visited Sirmione and Belaggio for half a day each and left exhausted from all the people.

●Unexpectedly enjoyed Genoa: I feel like it's not talked about enough as an interesting destination.

Not sure if these are useful recommendations,  but I'd love to hear your thoughts about these takes - maybe I'm totally wrong?

ItalyTravel,"What a wonderful 2 weeks it has been!

Before the trip, I was very nervous, not because of my nerves but because of other people constantly telling me to be safe, be proactive, be this, be that etc. I even packed in a little teddy bear as a travel companion in case I got lonely being by myself. 

Guys, that poor teddy didn't get a single glimpse of Italy because I was completely taken away by the places I visited. 

Rome - very warm but also very rainy when I went (Sept 3 - 7). I walked almost 20km on my first day! Food was very easy to manage as I wasn't looking for restaurants to dine at, but more just easy takeaway options or cafe options where service was quick so I could keep sightseeing. I probably should have packed in an umbrella. 

My hotel was right around the corner from the Colosseum so the only time I caught a taxi anywhere was to reach the Vatican City at 7:30am. I felt very safe, I was never approached by any bracelet sellers or scammers, but I did watch them and their tactics which were very unsubtle. You can spot these people from a mile away and avoid them.

Florence - I caught the Italo train to Florence (Sept 7 - 11). Something to know is that the time listed for your train is the time it takes off from the platform, not when it arrives on the platform. Very easy to store baggage either near the door or above the seats, and I had confirmed seats booked in advance so no hassle at all. Florence initially felt a little more sketchier than Rome because the main attraction areas like the Duomo and galleries were so close together that there wasn't much space for tourists to disperse. I stayed a few steps away from the Duomo and when I checked-in, a lady had her passport stolen a few minutes before that. I kept my passport in a money belt under my clothes so I didn't face any issues. 

I had some amazing pizettes at this place called Ganza right next to the 3 main All'Antico Vinaio in the city centre. The history of Florence, the Medici Family, the beautiful galleries, artworks, historic buildings was breathtaking. Highly recommend doing the Secret Passages Tour of the Palazzo Vecchio! It was only 5 euros extra!! 

Milan - This was the entire reason for my trip, to celebrate my birthday in the city of my dreams (Sept 11 - 14). Initially, Milan freaked me out because I felt completely out of this city's league. Everyone looked like super models whereas I looked like a touristy potato. But I grew to love it very quickly and gained a lot of new confidence walking around these fancy boutique stores and dessert shops. Highly recommend attending a concert on the Milan rooftop terraces during the sunset. It was absolutely magical and had such a romantic vibe, I really missed my partner. My birthday breakfast was at The Dome - Milano, which was an okay place for a fancy treat, but next time I would try Marchesi in the Gallery. Milan was a little more difficult to find on-the-go food because most food places were seated restaurants and mostly meat-based like Florence, but I managed just fine. 

This was the only place I was approached by a rose seller. They tend to hang around the Duomo area after dusk and I felt the area becoming a little sketchy after sundown. I went to the Duomo area around 7:30am and it was a lot nicer to visit the gallery and get solo photos without people.

Overall, I've had the best birthday trip ever and I'm heading back home to Australia now. I took out all of the clothes from my luggage and have stuffed in as many snacks as I possibly could. 

Happy to answer any questions anyone has about these places. I didn't mention any attractions as they've been covered a lot before.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone, yesterday I returned home from a wonderful 5 day trip in Rome. Beautiful city which I can't wait to return to.

However, there was an incident on Saturday evening, after the Italy vs Scotland Rugby match where my dad got his phone pickpocketed. **The good news** is we were actually able to track his phone down and retrieve it, which has lead me to question what may have been going through the minds of the pickpocketers.

For context: he first noticed his phone was gone after we'd got on a packed bus after the rugby. There had been a lot of commotion and large crowds as people tried to get back into the city centre. I had also noticed groups of young kids running about ""playing tag"" around and in between groups of people in the bus station. In hindsight, I believe they were a coordinated pickpocket ring and they were probably the ones who took my dad's phone, right out of his jeans pocket.

We got off the bus and my sister started calling my dad's number, repeatedly, for 5 - 10 minutes. The phone hadn't been switched off, the number hadn't been blocked, it would ring and ring and then go to voicemail, so she kept trying.

Eventually, a man answered and in broken English said he found the phone discarded on the ground at the complete opposite side of the bus station (where we'd never been). Within a couple minutes we had met him and my dad had his phone back. Grateful beyond words 🙏 we even offered him money as a reward, which he refused.

My question is; why would the pickpockets discard the phone? My dad's phone has a leather case, which made me think maybe they thought they'd taken his wallet? He also has thumbprint protection, so they wouldn't have been able to access anything. Maybe my sister's incessant calling had them spooked, if they were just kids?

I was wondering if anyone from Rome who understands the culture of pickpocketing could explain? We honestly thought he'd never get his phone back. Again, thank you so much to the kind samaritan who retrieved and returned his phone. Grazie!!!",t2_12h7z0,My dad had his phone pickpocketed in Rome.

After that, the two hard to move people blocking the ticket stamper identified themselves as fare checkers. They took our tickets and insisted that we had previously used the tickets and stamped the back side before. They were showing us… nothing on the back on our tickets as proof. Then they fined us €80 euro (€40 each).

ItalyTravel,"Reddit/tripadvisor/ricksteves were all great resources in getting my family prepared for our recent trip to Italy.  I thought I would pass along the very few places where they steered me wrong or could have saved me a lot of trouble.

Advance booking of trains on day of arrival:  The consensus advice was to book all of our train tickets in advance except on the day of arrival.  The logic is that the uncertainty of flight delays and time to get through customs/baggage would lead to a high likelihood of changing trains, and there is no price advantage to buying fully changeable tickets in advance.  In practice, lack of wifi on the Malpensa train and 3rd party verification problems with the train station wifi made for a very stressful last minute ticket purchase with no choice of fair class or seats that would allow my family to sit together.  If I had it to do again, I would have booked tickets in advance with a reasonable cushion for delays, and dealt with changes as they came.

Italian cell phone service:  We decided to get one phone a physical SIM from TIM with an Italian number and use it as a hotspot for the remaining family to have mobile data and wifi calling/texting.  This worked, but I purchased the SIM and plan from a physical TIM store at Milan station after hearing horror stories surrounding the voucher system for advance purchases of their 25 euro plan on their website.  However, when I went to purchase the same plan at the store, they charged 40 euro and told me the 25 euro price was only available through the online voucher process.  If I had known that, I might have tried my luck with the voucher.

Naples train transfers:  We arrived in Naples by high speed train and had tickets on the Campania Express to Sorrento.  The problem here is that signage is horrible at this train station.  If you get off a train at Napoli Centrale and look for any signs for a train called Campania Express to Sorrento departing from Piazza Garibaldi, you will not see any signs to get you to the right place until you are already there.  We ended up blowing our hour of cushion trapped in a mass of people waiting for the wrong train leaving at the same time, missing our train and taking a later Circumvesuviana as a backup.

App recommendations:  Most recommendations I found were good, but Moovit (for navigating public transportation) was a disaster.  It's primary function appears to be draining battery and turning phones into space heaters, and gives information that appears similar to google maps.  Even if the directions were better, they are no good to me if the phone it runs on has a dead battery.

Just went to Italy for the second time, and this time I actually had a lot of uncomfortable/rude encounters that I feel like I can attribute to racism. I am sharing this just so other POC can prepare themselves on just what might be expected, as these details aren’t shared in travel guides usually.

When I went to Rome, there was this guy eating with his family who kept staring nonstop at us during dinner. Like, as soon as we were directed to the table, he started staring at us with an unwelcoming and bothered expression. It proceeded almost unwaveringly, and I had enough when he started looking at one of my party member’s phones and then rolling his eyes. So I asked him if he had an issue, and he proceeded to act clueless. I told him to stop staring and set a better example for his young son. He wanted to argue saying that he wasn’t doing anything but his mom and wife (?) stopped him, and I told him if he had any issue he could talk to the waiter about it, and I would talk to the waiter if he kept staring. I could tell that his family was very uncomfortable with the whole situation and they ate in silence after that.

Before we left he apologized and tried to act really nice and told us he wasn’t a racist lmao (which ironically, through this disclosure, revealed that the issue at hand was indeed my race)

I was honestly kind of fed up because i was at the Milano Centrale train station earlier that day and some girl cut me in line for food, and she gave two separate excuses when i confronted her about it. When I didn’t give into her bs she was like ""you know I tried to be polite"" and stormed off.

And while aboard the train to Rome, I was walking to my seat, and there were so many older Italian people who just kept staring at me. The train that I was on had seating in a table configuration, so you had to face the next row of people on board across a table. Funnily enough, I sat next to a (white) American couple visiting and across the aisle there were 2 older Italian ladies who seemed to be staring at me. I stared back and they would look away but I found them staring at me more. I don’t think they stared at all at the other American couple, who frankly were speaking pretty loudly in English

My assessment is that they are used to treating asians from their home countries poorly because they can usually get away with it. In my case, as an East Asian American, I feel like they think they can pull this type of stuff because east asians from asia generally aren't privy to what racism/microaggressions look like, and even if they are, they usually dont feel comfortable enough expressing themselves to do anything about it.

At the train station in Milan, we were stopped by a group of military/police officers who asked to see my passport for verification. I questioned it and asked if I could see ID or a badge because I was wary that it was a scam (have heard of something similar before), and one of the officers said show it to me right now or else you’re going to get in trouble and he put his hand on his baton or gun. Once they saw my US passport they started apologizing and asked me if I needed any help with directions. 

Either way, I still had a great time in Italy all in all - but I think these types of trip reports should be shared as well

ItalyTravel,"Of course you should see the major historic sites and important things, most beautiful landscapes, etc. I would advise anyone to do this. But I think many people would be surprised at how many towns there are in Italy are they’ve probably never heard of and that are really amazing. A question that comes up a lot is, “Is this place worth seeing?” The answer is almost always yes, with the caveat that there might be a lot of lesser known places that are almost equally nice. 

In my experience, many, many Italian towns have a centrally located train station, a beautiful city square, historic church, historic architecture, great shops, great restaurants, great bars (meaning coffee shops). Exceptions to this would be towns that were heavily bombed in WWII or places in the south that have had earthquakes over the years. Even in these cases where the architecture is not historically pristine, it’s still an amazing experience with the walkable town layout, bars, and restaurants. If any one of these towns were transported to North America, they’d be a top tourist destination.

I just advised someone to do this in a comment but I’ll add it here as well: look up a train route on Trenitalia and look up one of the smaller stops on Google maps. Look up the town name plus “stazione” (station). Then go to the interactive map and wander around. If you google the town name plus “cattedrale” or “duomo” you can see how long it will take to walk to the historical town center and what the walk would look like. So far I haven’t seen many places I wouldn’t love to spend a day in.

Our server was really kind to us (to our face) but we could hear the staff talking about us and laughing. Then they changed their music from quiet piano  music to Tu vuo fa l’americano loudly and we actually thought that was kind of funny until our server came over at the end of our meal and asked where we were from. When we told him he snickered that we ate too much and that Italians don’t eat that much (we each got a normal sized pizza and I ate about 1/2, my husband finished his) 

We left there feeling really soured, so I’m hoping this is not the norm? Or is it mostly a one-off experience? We felt so badly leaving there and we have 3 days left. ",t2_4jy0077l,Tourists in Salerno ,0.88,122,1716233716.0,1716233716.0,94,egiurleo,1cwo8v4
ItalyTravel,"We've done a few nights in Rome, Florence, Pisa, San Gimignano, Siena, San Marino (I know this is not Italy), Milan and now just arrived in Genoa. I have felt so safe even at night in all cities so far, even going down alleys.

Genoa during the day has quickly risen to my top two cities in Italy so far for its shear beauty, and then about 4pm hit. Walked up an alley that had prostitutes standing in a bunch of doors, which didn't sketch me out but it was interesting seeing that as I hadn't seen it yet in Italy. But soon every street we went to had very sketchy people EVERYWHERE, eyeing us up and down constantly, purposely walking into us and bumping us, crowding us, blocking alleys in large groups. We tried to find our way to a main road for more light and more tourists, but it seemed impossible. Finally we found our hotel after feeling like we were unable to even pull out our phones to find directions.

Has anybody else had a similar experience here? I'm still going to go out, but I think I'll stick to the main roads.

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone it's our time for our long vacation report

I have been on this subreddit for quite some time reading about suggestions, recommendations and things to be aware of, so I thought I might share our trip

We went for 15 days to Italy as follows

Venice (3 days)
- such a beautiful city full of charm and history
- visited the Saint mark basilica, doges palace, Belltower, Rialto bridge, fenice theater, bridge of sighs, Arsenal, some of the basilicas and churches around and during the night walking around the alleys and small plazas enjoying everything.
- Murano, burano and torcello, burano was the most beautiful, I would say visit torcello if you really have the time otherwise spend more time in the other islands, we only saw some ruins and a church there, buy a day pass if using vaporetto 
- hidden gem: fondaco dei tedechi, it's a terrace by Ponte Rialto with great views, it's free but you have to book way in advance, tickets go out really fast, check their website
- some areas of the vaporettos entrances only have a tapping machine, from what I read you can tap on your entries and if you tap a third time it becomes a day pass so you don't pay more than needed 

Milan (2 days)
- I did liked the combination of modern and historic, one of my top 3
- visited the cathedral, we did the full ticket, (duomo, cathedral, crypt, archeological, missed the museum though) , Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, pinoteca di brera, teatro a la scala, some of the churchs and basilicas, the last supper painting, sforzesco castle, Parco sempione and navigli
- navigli was lovely at night, seeing the last supper painting was astonishing 
- public transportation was good metro ticket works on bus and trolleys, get a day pass if you are moving around
- if you are planning to see the last supper painting you have to book way in advance, they normally open the bookings a month and half before the time you are looking for, just keep checking the website as it sell out quick
- some things are free the first Sunday of the month, we got free tickets for the castle this way

Florence (2 days)
- this city was beautiful, quite crowded but everything was in a walking reach
- we did Uffizi gallery, Galleria de la academia, the cathedral, went up to the dome, baptistery, cappelle medicee, ponte Vecchio, Mercato centrale, Mercato del porcellino, Piazza de la signoria.
- this place has so much to see, more days are recommended.
- if you are going up to the bell tower or the duomo be prepared, bring water and a dark shirt, I had a white shirt and when I reached the top of the duomo it became orange because of the bricks, some spaces are tight
- app recommendation ""the fork"", we had our wedding anniversary here and I booked through the App a good rated restaurant, the app gave us a 50% discount on most of the items of the menu so we had to try a bistecca Fiorentina with some pasta and a Chianti Classico, and my god, that steak was amazing, if you have the chance try it, it melts in your mouth
- mercato centrale has some good leather products and at decent prices, what they show outside is the cheap and generic, but inside their stores there are more designer products, talk with their owners about the leather and where it comes from.

Pisa( 1 day)
- this city was very peaceful, very walkable, main stuff to see is just the Piazza of miracoli, quite enjoyable walks around the city
- went to the Piazza of miracoli, up to the tower, the cathedral, the baptistery, campo santo, sinopie museum, Piazza del cavallieri, Chiesa de Santa Maria de la spina
- public transportation (bus) is good
- this city was nice for 1 day trip, 

Rome (2 days)
- we have been here before so the walking around was more chill, nonetheless I love Rome, 
- visited saint Peter basilica, Vittorio Emanuele monument and terrace, doria pamphilij gallery, the pantheon, the papal basilica, walked around the colliseum, Palatine hill, Roman forum, Piazza navona,Spanish steps, Trevi fountain, Piazza del popolo among other things
- Rome needs more time, so much stuff to see
- public transportation is good but it can get quite crowded 
- in the center everything is walkable and you can see quite a lot in a short time

Naples (2 days)
- I can only summarize this city as a vibrant and dirty mess
- the public transportation is bad, we couldn't get a bus from the train station to the center, subways lines were down from a strike, and when they did work they take 20 min to get into the station, we had to use taxis here
- we stayed close to scappanapoli and it was pretty nice, seeing the shops, restaurants and small alleys was cool
- visited San severo chapel, complessso de santa chiara, Chiesa del gesu nuovo, girolamini, duomo de naples, basilica Reale, sant elmo castle, Pompeii, walked around San Carlo theatre, Piazza del plebiscito, Galleria Umberto Eco 
- food was cheap and pretty tasty, nice pizzas, people were nice and friendly
- things we didn't liked here beside the transportation, there was garbage everywhere, mopeds everywhere in the small alleys and these guys didn't care about walking people, they would throw you the bike if you didn't moved aside, the basilica Reale had a lot of grafitti outside
- if you wanna visit Pompeii, do it from Sorrento I would say

Salerno (3 days)
- stayed in Salerno but we were taking Ferries to the Amalfi coast
- day 1: positano, it was a living postcard, we loved this place and walking around the streets, looked the shops full of lemons ceramics, public beach is small unless you wanna pay for a sunbed
- day 2: Amalfi, it was nice, walked around and got lost in the small alleys as you went up certain stairs, the beach and the water was great and refreshing, tons of stores and gelato places all selling you the same lemon sorbet and donkey ceramics, the church was pretty cool, we saw you could go to ravello or Minoru from here but we preferred to enjoy the beach and the water to relax
- day 3: Capri, or it would have been, ferry was canceled due the bad weather, so we stayed in Salerno, walking in the center and then having a nice meal, after that prepare for our return and relax until then

So, some tips of what we gathered on our trips

Tips:

- book as most as you can in advance, including trains and ferries, research your places to go, a lot of their online tickets include a skip the line feature or sell out pretty fast 
- restaurants will charge a fee called coperto, it's normally stated in their menu, sometimes fro 2.50 to 5 per person, tipping is not required in italy
- method of transportation between cities, high speed train, frecciarossa, quite reliable, go to the official website trenitalia for tickets, for Ferries try travel Mar, we tried alicoast for Capri but had no luck because of the weather
- money: we carried some cash with us but for the rest we used Wise, their conversion rate was pretty good when converting euros, and Italy has tap system everywhere, even the city tax at hotels can be paid by card, so we recommend it
- weather was crazy, almost everyday was hot, get light colored clothes or linen/part linen clothes and a sun hat/straw hat
- sunblock!
- we had a carry-on and a back pack each and managed well between the tight streets, try not to overload your baggage or bring many luggage, hotels or airbnb have laundry machines you can use
- we had a couple of foldable backpacks one 10L and a 20L, when we arrived to the hotel we would leave the luggage and big backpack, took either foldable with water bottles, shades, pain medicine (advil, roblax, icy hot) and went or way to explore, so very recommended
- so, pickpockets, we can say we weren't victims of them, seeing this subreddit post about them made me paranoid and we got moneybelts for passport carrying and the cash we weren't using that day, I had a cross body bag that worked well and my wife had her purse, I recommend buying little hook locks from Amazon they worked quite well, they are a bit hard to open and you can feel when they try to open them
- we saw a lot of scam artists in all the cities, mostly rose scam and bracelet scam, if they come close to you do no give them your hand or accept anything they give you
- be aware of your surroundings and you'll be fine
- vacuum bags worked quite well to store clothes and leave good space in your carry on, buy a mobile vacuum pump 
- recommended apps, ""the fork"", for searching and booking restaurants, sometimes the app give you a good discount and the restaurant respect it, ""where is the toilet"", lifesaver, it shows you all the public toilets around you, ""acea wady wow"", for finding water, Italy has water taps all around, this app will tell you where they are, ""airalo"" for your phone esim, great option, cheap and easy to install esims, ""wanderlog"" for trip planning, 
- whenever you are spending more than €70 you should always ask for a tax refund form to the store, either bring your passport with you or a copy of it to show, to claim the money once you go to the airport and before you pass security to the gates there should be a section called ""vat refund""

ItalyTravel,"It's entirely different from everywhere else in Italy when it comes to ambience, food and coffee and $, even shopping. It's a different beast. It's entirely touristy from my perspective. It's a little lost. It's absolutely beautiful to walk around and certainly one of the most special places on earth but it doesn't have the things I like best about Italy. 

The museums are a little expensive and not as a magnificent as the ones you find casually in Rome, the palazzos don't compare to the scale and wealth of those in even Genoa, the hotels seemed pretty awful upon review for price/value ratio. The streets are pretty crowded even the week after Easter when it's not full summer tourist season, you had full on traffic jams full of strollers, yelling teenagers, big percent non-italian but tourists. 

The price of food is on par more with Paris or London, and the quality is far below Rome, Florence, Naples, even Amalfi/Positano I found to have better and cheaper food? The coffee was even over priced and not good on average which I found disappointing. 

Usually traveling in Italy you have this wow I never want to leave, I want to move right here feeling. In Venice it's like wow, this is pretty but please get me out of here. 

The far off streets seeing the light hit the canals is absolutely beautiful, I'm glad I saw it. It could be nice for a few days as a romantic trip off season, I can't believe how someone could enjoy it in the busiest season, paying full price for a teeny hotel, and spending new york prices on dinners and lunches that don't kiss the boot of a cheap one the same in Rome. 

Also!! I used to collect little Murano candies, each time I went to Rome I'd go to the Murano store next to the Santa Maria Novella store near Piazza Navona and it felt very special-- in Venice it's f'ing everywhere and I'm pretty sure it's all made in China? None of the little shops look nice. That was a bummer. 

Anyway, it's a place that gets pounded by tourists but I wanted to write this to say, please, someone visiting for the first time consider just skipping it if food and coffee and italian culture are things you care a lot about-- you could really see more beauty and have a more lovely time in a small town in many parts of the country.

ItalyTravel,"Fellow travelers beware!

I know that probably all of you plan ahead of time and have digital tickets and stuff, but unfortunately this time wasn’t my case.

I arrived around 2:00 pm at the line outside of the museum, and at the start of the line there was a “Museum staff man” (he had a uniform, name tag and everything, looked legit) who was asking for everyone to show their ticket so he could separate them in the two separate lanes (right for scheduled entrance and left for the other) 

As I said I didn’t have a ticket so he proceeded to tell me that I had to buy them before going into the line, this was news to me because as far as I know the left line was for people like me who didn’t have a ticket , he proceeded to try and lure me away from the crowd and started to tell me that he could sell the tickets to me , started to name prices, the first red flag was that he tried to sell me tickets to enter the basilica (which is free of entrance) so as soon as I heard that, I told him to fuck off and I came back to the end of the line

I’m making this post because I believe that if I haven’t been there before I would’ve felt for it and paid the €200 euros  he was trying to charge me.

For context, we’re from North Jersey and frequent NYC - if you’re used to a city environment, Rome is no different, but in no way worse! Yes there are crowds by major attractions and there will be some people who are a bit sketchy, but nothing to the lengths I read about.

We stayed there our first night in Europe/Rome and got bitten badly by bed bugs, just to realize the bed was crawling with both adult and newborn bugs all over. I researched this place and found an Airbnb listing for this place (now taken down) with multiple reviews from this year about how there are bed bugs, with the owner claiming they are lying and/or he brought an exterminator but they did not see any bed bugs. I wrote a negative review just for the owner to say we brought them (lol) and that we were lying. It’s pretty clear the owner does not care nor wants to fix the issue.

ItalyTravel,"My hubby and I were first time international travelers to Rome and Florence last month and I thought I would share some info (**many seasoned travelers will already know, but good for newbies).** 

\*take some Euros with you, we got $100 in 5 Euro denominations and it really saved us time when we first got there, not having to worry about 'where to get money'. Once you break it with your first (NOT LAST) gelato, you will appreciate having the coins in case you have to use a public WC  
\*everything is on Italian time, so be flexible  
\*ORDER THE HOUSE WINE, it's almost always a great choice and affordable  
\*Take an extension cord (we both have CPAPS and there aren't usually a lot of outlets)  
\*both of our hotels had full 'American' style breakfasts  
\*Stay near the METRO (ROME) and use it! On your first day, do a test run to get the gist  
\*Guided tours (skip the line) for both the Coliseum and Vatican were the best money we spent.   
\*Download any tours on Rick Steve's App - for the churches and Pantheon it was awesome  
\*Take a travel umbrella or ponchos and follow the weather, we got caught in two torrential rainstorms  
\*After you pack, unpack half of it! you can re-wear dresses and many outfits and save the space for souvenirs   
\*If you go into a church your shoulders and thighs MUST be covered, carry a scarf. I ended up buying a 20' golf skort (wicking) and it was a lifesaver.  
\*We took a train from Florence to Rome and the non-upgraded regular class was just fine. They have compartments to store luggage.  
\*location is important in a hotel, not amenities.   
\*At both of our  hotels, we had to put our room key in a slot near the door to turn on the lights and AC (I had never seen this in the USA) AND, in Rome (95 degrees outside) once you remove the key the AC cycles down. It does not cool off like AC in the US.   
\*Take either a handheld fan or buy a fan when you get there. Many museums and churches get stuffy and it was nice to be able to use.

ItalyTravel,"Other than pickpocketing strategies to look out for, some things I wish I knew before I traveled:

1. When you're seated at a restaurant, there will be a ""coperto"" charge of 9 euros (for 2 people). It seems to cover the cost of your seating (not a tax or tip).

2. Ask for a smoke-free zone to be seated in if you're not a smoker because there are a ton of smokers.

3. Public transport was very reliable in Milan but not in Rome. In Rome, you may come to the station stop and check if there is a board with arrival updates. It was reliable and up-to-date unlike Google maps data. 

4. When traveling to Rome airport, I used S.I.T bus. We happened to arrive early for our bus and were able to get on the previous bus that was running late by 18 minutes. Make sure you plan your time-sensitive trips in advance.

5. Taxi drivers may cancel a ride and ask for higher fare in cash. Stand your ground or just leave if you're late. I fell for this trick because we were late to our Vatican tour.

6. Coffee/cappuccino costs about 1.5 euros unless you're in a tourist area (4-5 euros). Keep looking for cheaper options. Water costs cents if you purchase at a supermarket vs. 3-5 euros.

7. Most importantly: perhaps it's sad to confess but I only enjoyed Italy's cities during 4:00 - 8:00 in the morning. I like seeing people but constantly being conscious of the crowd takes away the attention from sightseeing. There is also no tourist noise in the early morning. The crowd and the noise make you feel as if the city is artificial or as if you're walking in a mall. I could fully immerse myself and appreciate history in early morning walks only. We also had colosseum tickets but because of the sun and crowd, it felt like I've seen more in gladiator movie. Oy oy oy! Too bad I was spent on the last day, otherwise I was planning to marvel at colosseum and the arch from the outside in the early morning.

8. I was also slightly worried about racism (central asian) and apprehension towards tourists (because there are too many), but at least on the surface, I noticed no such thing. It may also have had to do with us only visiting tourist cities. People were very friendly and tried to be helpful even if they didn't speak English. One time in Venice, ~ 4 in the morning, we were out of water and everything was closed, so I approached the workers to ask where I could find it. They offered me a bottle from their stock and did not even take the money I offered as payment.

9. Dressing: we were dressed fine but I was surprised to see super casual outfits, some of which were revealing, especially in Vatican!!! The cover-ups women were given were also somewhat transparent...So if you're short on time before a trip and don't have many outfit options, don't fret too much.

ItalyTravel,"I would like to share my experience buying Colosseo tickets as they have made some changes to the website. The information below was valid on June  1, 2024.

Background: I am an IT guy who is data-driven. I have been planning/analyzing the patterns to establish the best “plan of attack” on how to procure tickets on the old coop site and now the new website for months.  

--> **Tickets ARE on a rolling release 720hours ahead of time, Rome time**

Whichever tickets you are targeting ( underground tour, attico etc ) will only appear exactly to the second 720 hours ahead of time.

Example : You want Attico ticket for 8h50AM(Rome time) for July 1st

The ticket will show available only on June 1 at 8h50AM(Rome time). There will be NO other time slot showing. Then whichever next time slot is available will pop again when it reaches that 720 hours ahead of time. Previous time slots will show up whether there are available tickets or not 

This is valid for Individuals or Guided tours.



Tips :

1- Tickets in the morning are harder to get for any full-experience tickets

2- Tickets may show ""sold out"" but re-appear available as someone put them in their cart to ""test"" but did not purchase. The system will give back those tickets 15 minutes later so if you don't get them, you may still have a chance.

3- I recommend using 2 internet sources as the system will think you are 2 different clients; using multiple browsers you will appear as the same IP. If their system is smart, it will know you are the same person and won't show you different results. At least, this is what I have experienced. 

I used my computer with my home internet and my phone using my carrier data. I was getting different results and sometimes,  tickets were shown as available on one and not the other no matter if I refreshed or not. Not sure if this is a bug 

4- If you want to give yourself the best chance at getting attico or underground morning tickets, I would recommend you get in the system around 8h15am(Rome time) . You will be put in the Cloudflare queue for 20-40 minutes and then get access to the website.

Tickets may not be released yet but this gets you out of the queue and browsing the website. I don't know how fast they kick you out ( and put you back in the queue) but I would think 5-10 minutes of inactivity. I was “browsing” other tickets every 2-3 minutes so it doesn't think I am idling.

5- The English Underground guided tour does vanish within a second. I used an atomic clock and even then, it's a question of luck. If your browser is lucky and refreshes on the exact time you may win the lottery. I would recommend having a plan B like I did and taking Attico tickets. I was never able to get more than 2 tickets for it . Again I think there is a certain amount of luck involved and perfect timing. 

6- I have done both Underground and Attico and both are great. Don\`t be pissed if you don\`t see the underground , you do see \~90% of it from above

My wife and I just got back from our two week honeymoon across Italy, and (as expected) we were absolute gluttons. So. Many. Carbs.

We normally have a good balanced diet - light breakfast, low-card lunch, then a protein, starch, and veggie dinner.

In Italy, breakfast was very pastry heavy. Lunch was commonly pasta or pizza. Dinner was whatever the hell we wanted. Usually pasta and more cards lol.

Two days back and my body continues to crave the carbs. I just feel 100% hungry 100% of the time right now haha.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all,

I am visiting Italy and had to take the train from Sanremo to Milan today. I purchased a first class ticket and my seat was at the back of the train. The very last seat available. 

One station before Milan a man walks in and claims that he is seated right next to me, so I moved and gave him his seat. He started talking to me in Italian and when he realized I don’t speak it, he said “where are you from?”. Once I replied, he said something in Italian and then rushed to the bathroom. Once he came back, he put his backpak on top where the luggage was.

There was an older man seated in front of me with some tourists. He was traveling alone though and had his LV luggage and LV backpack stored on top.

The guy who was seated next to me took both bags and rushed right away. I was confused at first as theft isn’t common where I’m from but then I realized that he had grabbed the LV backpack that doesn’t belong to him along with his backpack. 

We were maybe 20 minutes away from the final stop and I alerted the man in front of me once I realized that he had taken his bag too. The thing is, the guy in front was an older man - maybe 70 years old or so and he started panicking. Thank god he spoke English and understood what I was saying.

The thief ran into the bathroom most likely as the lady next to us was unable to enter the bathroom. She said it was locked and inaccessible. Once the train has stopped, I told the older man that he’s probably there as it’s locked and the same lady also helped to provide his description and confirm this.

Is this common? I really hope the older man got his backpack back 😭 Makes me so sad that people are so trash.

Well, it's always, always rigged! The ball/card is taken out during shuffling, when you are asked to find it it is in the cheater's sleeve, not in front of you. Do you see someone winning a ton of money before you? That's an accomplice who is let win to convince fools to try.

ItalyTravel,"Hello all!

At the tail end of a LOVELY week in italy, more to come on that—we’re staying at a hotel in amalfi. upon check in, they let us know they could offer us a discount for paying cash instead of card at checkout. while we initially declined, after discussing it more we decided to move some $$ from our savings and see if we could withdraw it from an ATM in town and let them know. because of the holiday yesterday, the $$ did not hit my checking account in time. while I could drain my account to cover the cost, this seems unwise and we decided against it. 

when we let reception know, they were visibly upset and let us know this would be a problem. they suggested we head back into town and withdraw using my card and my husbands card, despite us telling them it was not possible. 

it’s left a bad taste in our mouths after such an idyllic few days. did we commit a major faux pas? is this typical? did we create a big problem for them? we feel that notifying us wednesday afternoon of this possibility with a major us holiday in between our weekend checkout makes it a tight squeeze, we would’ve ordered more euro before leaving if we had known.

ItalyTravel,"Italian here, lazy/boring summer afternoon at work.

I love my country & visited most of it.  
I try to help sometimes here in the sub, especially trying to save tourists from Romeflorencevenicein7days itineraries (often failing).  
I think tourists could have such a better experience if they postpone (not skip) some usual ""must sees"" & combine just some of 'em with some underrated places. This would help not only their tourist experience, but also the usual ""must sees"" with the overtourism problem (so locals and other tourist's experience). Win-win.

I already did a similar Ask Me Anything [here (link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1egl0ys/top_20_underrated_italian_citiestowns_ama/) suggesting & answering about 20 underrated cities imho, hope it was good, let's try another one.

Yesterday in r/italy (italian sub about Italy) there was a great post: [""What is the most underrated city in Italy?"" (link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/1ewrfy6/qual_%C3%A8_secondo_voi_la_citt%C3%A0_pi%C3%B9_sottovalutata_in/) with 600+ comments so far. Plenty of great suggestions.  
Trying to facilitate it for you in this eng sub, here are the 16 cities that have been suggested (by Italians) as most underrated in Italy in the ""best"" ranked (by Reddit) 10 comments so far in the post:

North: **Torino/Turin, Mantova/Mantua** (x2)**, Padova/Padua, Trieste**  
Emilia-Romagna region: **Ferrara** (x2)**, Parma, Modena, Ravenna**  
Central: **Urbino, Jesi, Lucca**  
Umbria region: **Perugia** (x2)**, Gubbio, Assisi**  
South: **Matera, Bari**

This is no perfect lists (yes, ""underrated"" concept is debated.. yes, Reddit comment logic is kinda strange.. yes, it underestimates the South 'cause most Reddit italians are from the North..) as there isn't a perfect list, but let's be pragmatic: this is a really good list, all fantastic places. And ok, 10/16 cities were already in my first AMA's selection, haha.

So..... having visited all these 16 cities, I offer an AMA to the most curious of you: any questions or request of specific suggestions (which one is the best for X, how can I add X to my itinerary, what did you liked in X, local-food-to-try in X, what's the best base/way to visit X..) about these 16 underrated but AMAZING italian cities that I suggest you to inform about and absolutely to go to, JUST ASK!

ItalyTravel,"
I was prepared for good food in Bologna, but the food was just incredible! Maybe because I just came from Venice, where the scenery was incredible, but the food left much to be desired. Bologna, being the food capital of Italy, was high on my list of places to visit. 

Day 1:
Took the train from Venice to Bologna. Didnt realize the highspeed was underground, so the exit to ground level seemed for ever. Walked to our airbnb, and then headed for dinner at Trattoria da Me, which I made a reso a couple weeks earlier. Food and service was really good, had the cheese icecream appetizer with crescentina, gnocchi gratin with porcini, tagliatelle with ragu, iberian pluma, veal tongue, and mascarpone crema dessert. All very good. Would have made another reso except my parents wanted something else. 

Day 2:

Had a cappuccino and bomboloni at Hangout Cafe, just near our place. Grabbed some fresh fruits at Mercato delle Erbe. Went to Palazzo Poggi, which i really enjoyed. and cheap admission too. The collection of maps was my favourite. I'm into historic science navigation and architecture. The obstetrics room was something else.  

Had lunch at Sfoglina Rina. Lined up for 10 minutes and we were in. Had the green tagliatelle with ribiola cream, potato and spinach gnocchi, and black passatelli. 

Picked up some prosciutto and pesto Genovese from Salumeria Simoni, and then some gnocchi from Sfogline for later. 

Found a run club, NUR (Not Normal Run) which was awesome. Every Wed at 7pm. I think the run leader owns Pescheria Scampo, was pretty novel meetig up for a run outside a seafood restaurant. Had a post run dinner of octopus and rice, was delicious. Finished off with gelato (crema, nicciola) at Vero Gelateria, which might be my favorite in Bologna.

Day 3:
Caught the ~9am regional train to Ravenna. Easy to buy from kiosk, just validate it using the machine nearby, and go to the correct platform. Booked the church tickets on the train, and just selected the 5min windows for the masoleum. Its a small city, and was very easy to walk from the train station to the main sites. The mosaics were incredible, especially in the masoleum, baptistery, and San Vitale. 

Lunch was at Osteria Passatelli, thanks to a reddit recco, and was the best pizza of the trip so far. Just perfect sausage truffle pizza, tagliatelle ragu, and an octopus primi. Caught the 5pm-ish train back. Was never rushed and had plenty of time to wander. 

Dinner was at Antica Osteria Romagnola, where we ordered the mortadella starters, lasagna, and the suckling pig. Even though we got the 2x portion, it was too much for the three of us and we asked for a box to go. 

Day 4:
Had to work off all those meals to make room for more, so we walked up to San Luca. Be sure to stop at Bar Billi. It was a holiday Nov 1, so this place was packed. Impressive to watch the staff serve so many espressos so quickly. The church and view is nice, but the portico walk is the highlight. 

Lunch at Trattoria Amedeo, stumbled upon this place, barely a word of English spoken. Ordered bolognese cutlet (huge, so much cheese), seafood pasta (generous toppings and delicious), tortellini in broth. Good valued food. 

Wandering around the Centro some more, checked the sette chiese and San Petronio. Wanted to go to teatro anatomical, but it was closed today. Wasnt sure where to eat dinner, so we just went back to Sfogline Rina as we liked it. Ordered the lasanga, tortellini in parm and egg sauce, and tortelli special. All delicious. 

Day 5:
Checked out at 9am, went to Cafe Montebello for coffee while we waiting for the train. Arrived at station 40minute beforehand, and headed down to the highspeed platforms. i booked the tickets a month ago for a big discount, but no flexibility. 

TLDR: Bologna is amazing, food is great, its a place to live, not visit. 

Next stop, Florence for three days! Any recommendations for food and sights? 

Planning for:
Duomo Bell Tower and Dome
Accademia Gallery
possible daytrip to Siena
Galileo museum (more into science than arts, hence not Uffuzi)

ItalyTravel,"My wife and I just got back from 13 days in Italy and had a great trip. After reading some of the posts on here, I had a little trepidation about the dos/don'ts of Italy but we had no negative issues at all. 

We started planning in the spring with an overly ambitious itinerary. We cut it down to Campania and Rome. We also moved the dates from July to late September. The crowds were manageable and the weather was perfect.

We traveled light (and had concerns about theft) so we went with Pacsafe backpacks. It was painful seeing people dragging their oversized rolling suitcases over cobblestone streets.

We did not drive on this trip and would not recommend it. We had drivers, walked, used trains and used buses.

Sorrento was our initial base of operations. We stayed at the Grand Hotel Ambasciatori which has a great view of the Gulf of Naples.  

Restaurants we enjoyed were Lorelei, Enjoy the Little Things bistro, a newer place called NaLu and La Cantinaccia del Popolo (as well as a couple pizza and panini places for lunch. Our hotel actually made a great club sandwich). The gelato from Antica Gelataria delli' Accademia was tasty. We also developed a taste for limoncello spritzers!

 Our first excursion was to the hills over Sorrento for an agriturismo tour of a small farm (10 acres) ran by Francesco and his family for a pizza making class/limoncello tasting (called Agriturismo Primaluce ).

Our other Sorrento excursions included an all day group tour of climbing Mt Vesuvius to the crater, lunch and then Pompeii. Pompeii is a really cool site - bigger than I thought it would be. The next day we visited Herculenneum with a tour guide that was awesome (Maria Laura rocks!). She was also our guide the next day for the Naples Archeological Museum (MANN). That is an amazing place.

We took the ferry from Sorrento to Ischia. We stayed at the Hotel Grifo. Ischia was really relaxing and the bus around the island is really easy to use (we bought a 3 day pass). We walked to the Castello Aragonese d'Ischia and climbed it (great views of the island). There is a small street at Porto Ischia that has a lot of restaurants with a great seafood selection. We took an all day boat tour around the island with a number of spots to swim. The boat tour had people from all over the world and included lunch and plenty of prosecco and limoncello. We then spent one day at a thermal park called Negombo which waslaid back and relaxing (we ran into people from the boat tour at Negombo which was nice).

We then took the ferry to Naples and caught the Frecciarossa to Rome. The Naples train station was busy but manageable. Two things about the station - first we were told by our driver to locate our train by its number (versus the destination). Second,  they do not assign a platform until about 15-20 minutes before departure. The Frecciarossa is awesome - we were in Rome in 90 minutes.

Our hotel in Rome was the  Hotel Eitch Borromini at Piazza Navonna (it has a great rooftop bar). Rome is really walkable and this location was good for seeing the Roman forum and the Vatican (I recommend skip the line tours for the Vatican). Our guide for the Vatican was an older guy named Alberto who is a legend.

We took a golf cart tour of the Appian Way that was really unique. Just hanging off the back of the cart and seeing Romans driving was worth it.  It also took us out of the city center and included the Catacombs of San Sebastiano (where you can see the actual footprints of Jesus!).

The highlight of the trip for me was the afternoon visit to the Galleria Borghese. It is a great location, very well run and the collection is mind blowing. Our guide Francesca was fantastic. 

Our final tour was the Colosseum. It was a large group, hot and sunny. But the water fountains are free and our guide Massimo (the Sicilian) was really into it which made it a fun experience.

Some observations -

- We did not see any pickpocketing. However, there was a 3 card Monty game at the bridge coming back from the Vatican that was an obvious scam.
- There were a couple  bracelet scammers and flowers guys but they moved along after a ""no grazie.""
- Rome is such an amazing city. People visiting from everywhere. 
-  For some reason, people need to take LOTS of pics of themselves at the Trevi Fountain.
-  Rome has a jubilee starting in December so a few sites were ""wrapped up."" 
- We tipped our guides, housekeepers and drivers in cash.

Honestly I’m lucky he didn’t take the whole wallet. And if he could do ALL THAT without me noticing then, bravo, he deserves 100 euros 🤣

Do not take your hand off your bags. Have them close and high up on your chest. Shove your wallet somewhere with stuff on top of it so they don’t see it if they open your bag.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everybody! 

My wife and I are in Italy for our 15th anniversary. Our itinerary is 2.5 days in Florence, 2.5 days in Cinque Terre, and 3 days in Rome. Coming into the trip was a busy time and, while I got the major tickets bought, I wish I'd had more time to spend preparing mentally.

We had a great first day in Florence, doing the Duomo climb, strolling the streets, and eating good food. We just wrapped up our second day and it kind of went sideways. The Uffizi was great, as was All'Antico Vinaio. But then the Palazzo Pitti and the Boboli Gardens left is feeling flat. I think we're kind of ""arted out"", if that makes sense. We found ourselves wandering. My wife wanted to do the Piazzale Michelangelo at sunset, but the timing was weird and I probably wasn't thinking straight. So I led us in convincing ourselves not to do it. Instead we headed back into town and had an honestly mediocre dinner at Dall'oste. And now, back in the hotel, I can't sleep because I feel like a colossal screw-up. 

We're doing David tomorrow, but besides that I don't feel like seeing much else. The cathedrals are beautiful from the outside, but I don't have the urge to pay for tickets inside. We're facing rain over the next couple of days and I'm finding myself strangely dreading the rest of this trip. Like, I'm not excited about Rome. And it kills me to feel like I'm letting my wife down. She's the best person I know, and she deserves better than I've got in me right now. It's probably the last chance we'll get to do this thing, so I don't want to be in a funk. 

So, here I am, a ball of anxiety and self-loathing, asking for advice. What things can I do over the next few days to get mentally back in the game? What would you focus on in my shoes?

EDIT: I can't thank you all enough for your kind words. I literally cried as I was reading them last night. That was much better. We actually really loved David, and had a fantastic meal at Osteria di Caterina. Just got to CT, and it's raining, but we laughed at the absurdity of it as we hiked up and down the mountain from our room to dinner. The view from our place is truly breathtaking. We got a local sweet bread (kinda like pannetone) to have for breakfast tomorrow in our room, and we're going to take it easy and chill while we see what the weather decides to do.

ItalyTravel,"Here’s the thing… 
Getting advice from people on Reddit is nice and definitely helpful, but, do your own thing. Experience Italy on you own. This is the most amazing country I have ever been to. Walk into the cafe that has no English on the menu, ask the bartender what bottle of wine or Cicchetti (or aperitivo) they would order if they were in your shoes. Be freakin friendly to the locals, smile, wave, say Grazie, sit at a table on the street and just relax and smile while drinking wine or whatever kind of beverage you prefer. Don’t be a tourist dick head,and  ask politely for reccomendations. The people who live here aren’t your servants. They have, in my experience, have been happy to help!

ItalyTravel,"Just want to say I loved Naples so much more than I expected, and I had high expectations!

I’ve been to Milan, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Cinque Terre, Rome (not all in the same trip) and now Naples and Pompei and Amalfi and I have to say I loved Naples the most! (Bologna was very underrated) 

Things I loved:
1) the streets had so much character, some of the graffiti was actually really well done and lots of good public art
2) the pizza, don’t need to say more
3) the amazing ancient staircases
4) the castles
5) not over run by tourists! 
6) so walkable, but found the metro really nice
7) weather was great, though most of Italy is during March
8) streets were lively and fun but not centered around alcohol, which I find is the case for lively city streets in the USA. As someone who doesn’t like drinking alcohol I found this refreshing.
9) I experienced zero price gouging! So refreshing for a tourist. To get up to the castle for an amazing view and a great tour it was only 2.5 euros.


Misconceptions I had going in:
1) I would be in danger. I’ve felt more in danger in most USA cities more than Naples. I was just in New Orleans over winter and that city has 10 times the danger feeling.
2) trash would be horrible. There was a ton of litter, but no more trash piles than I see in NYC. This of course could be improved upon. 
3) the circumvesuvana (train that gets you to Pompei and the almafi) would be horrible. Not the case! It was nice I thought! Though a little dated. And everyone respectful in the train, which is a huge grow for people in the USA. 
4) (added later than first post) I heard the central train station area was horrible and should be avoided. It really wasn’t bad at all. Yes some homeless people (gasp) but that’s every train station and it wasn’t nearly as bad as the greyhound station in my hometown (Houston)


Just wanted to express my gratitude over a life changing city! I’m cutting my time in almafi short a bit to get an extra day in Naples since I couldn’t go to the main museum or cattacombs since I ran out of time.

Final comments: I found the town of Pompei itself to be very pleasant. Least favorite part of the trip was Sorrento itself, and the bus ride to Positano (they pack too many people on there, it’s not safe and I felt claustrophobic) 

Edit to all the questions: Sorrento was lovely, it was just offseason for tourists and not a ton was open and it just came across as a more fake town build towards tourists. ",t2_4duqkgwj,Naples was amazing! Thank you Italy,0.95,98,1710273256.0,1710273256.0,70,GlitteringBowler,1bd6rlf
ItalyTravel,"I joined this sub a few weeks before my trip to Italy, and I noticed many negative posts about people's experiences while traveling there. Naturally, this made me anxious. But now that I've returned, I want to share my positive experience to show that it’s not as bad as it might seem. Keep in mind that people often share negative experiences more than positive ones, which can create a skewed perspective.

After reading through posts here, I made plans accordingly, especially regarding destinations, handling personal belongings, and general safety. I was a bit worried before the trip, but I’m happy to say everything went smoothly.

We never encountered pickpockets, scammers, or troublesome individuals throughout our trip. If we came across anyone who seemed like they could be a hassle (like people selling roses or bracelets), we simply avoided them or politely declined, and they didn’t pursue us. We traveled with a crossbody bag and a camera with a mid-sized lens and had no issues. Hotel and Airbnb staff were incredibly helpful too.

One memorable night, we missed our last bus and ferry back to Sorrento and found ourselves stranded in Amalfi around 10 PM on a Sunday. When we called our Airbnb host to see if she knew of any alternatives to the taxis (which were quoting outrageous prices), she found a local taxi driver in Sorrento willing to pick us up at a much lower rate. To ensure our safety, she even accompanied the driver on the trip, which felt really heartwarming given it was so late, and it was a round trip for her and the driver. In the end, though, we found a taxi in Amalfi for a lower price.

Overall, we found people to be genuinely kind. Like in any country, you just need to stay aware of your surroundings and be mindful of your belongings. Also, respect the locals and their daily lives, so your tourism doesn’t become a burden on them.

One person we met mentioned witnessing a bag being stolen on a train while the passenger slept. We made sure to keep our large luggage in the overhead storage and always kept smaller bags within sight or on our laps.

We were only asked for our passports when checking into hotels (and they even accepted soft copies). Most cities are active late into the night and feel safe, with locals being very helpful. We visited Sorrento, Positano, Amalfi, Pompeii, Rome, Verona, and Milan.

*  Scammers exist, mostly only around tourist-heavy locations (Near the Colosseum, Vatican, etc.) We kept our valuables in an anti-theft bag and never had any issues. If strangers walk up to you, just ignore them or wave them off and they will go away. We also used backpack locks for our bags. 
* Make reservations for the good restaurants but also wander around and try places that look good (and that are full of local italians). We found most of our favourite places this way! (Also just checking google reviews while standing outside)
*  Download and use the Omio App for Trains and buses (Honestly the best app) Super easy to use and book trains on, very reliable.
* Booking with the Omio app also prevents you from having to wait in line at the station, but still arrive early as it can be kind of hectic. That being said, they usually don't post the train platforms on the screen until about 10 minutes before leaving.
*  For tours, excursions, and things to do - use the Viator App.
* Learn some basic Italian including greetings, farewells, ordering coffee/croissant, etc. People really enjoy it when we carried over that Canadian politeness (We are Canadian) to Italian. We were taught to say Buenaserra (Good evening) but found most locals would say ""Buona Serata"" (Have a good evening). They throw Ciao and Prego out like crazy, so do the same. 
* For major touristy locations, it's great to see them at night. Many are just as beautiful at night all lit up, but are also super super less busy. We visited Trevi Fountain after dinner and drinks at about 1:00AM and it was great. 
*  Embrace the slow lifestyle. It is true that Italians eat large course meals and lunch/dinner are 2-3 hour events (Normally on Sundays but can be sprinkled through the week) If you go out to dinner, I really recommend doing the same. Pasta is *NOT* a main, it's something between app, first course, and then your main. We found servers were much kinder to us and were very friendly with us once they figured we weren't the average ""American"" tourists here for a quick bite. Holding onto the menu after ordering your bottle of wine and starter shows them you mean business.
* When at a restaurant, look at what everyone around you is ordering for food.  
* Servers don't check up on you, it is very common to wave them down or get their attention, something considered rude in Canada is quite normal in Italy. 
* Stay outside the main tourist areas. Although this will involve a lot of walking, the slower pace, quieter restaurants/bars and streets, the cheaper prices made it so worth it when we stayed outside the touristy hubs. We walked A TON in Rome but it allowed us to really see the entire beautiful city. 
* Public washrooms are very rare, many cost euros. Have some change on you. Many also don't have TP so carry some with you along with hand sanitizer. 
* Thankfully in Rome, water fountains are everywhere. If you have a bottle of water, you can fill it easily at the many fill stations. 
* May or not be relevant for you but get an umbrella. It rained a lot when we were there.
* Finish every dinner with a shot of Lemoncello. Some Lunches too...or just whenever you want. I don't think we paid for a single shot of Lemoncello.
* Cappuccino is for breakfast. Cafe (espresso) is very daytime/evening. Most meals other than breakfast end with a cafe. 
* You can get a beer with your meal at McDonalds for the same price as a coke. 
* Most places love when you pay in cash but a lot do accept credit card. Small restaurants, shops, and taxis very much prefer cashola.
* Many Italians usually eat dinner late (8:00pm or even later)

**Rome (2 nights)** We stayed at Giardino Del Lago Bed and Breakfast in the Trieste district. It has breakfast included (really friggin good breakfast) and is in a really nice area. As mentioned it is outside the tourist area but this area felt very safe and was quiet and close to the parks. We liked having breakfast included as we got comfortable with our surroundings in Rome. 

**Where did we eat while in Rome?** 

WHEN IN ROME! Eat the four roman pastas; Cacio e pepe, Carbonara, Amatriciana, and Alla Gricia. Famous four pastas from Rome. 

Pizza is amazing in Rome so eat it! (Pizza is different in every region, like much of italian food. In the north, its like Focaccia with pizza toppings)

**Lunch**

*  Marziali 1922 ($$) - Very good overall. Lots of meats/cheeses.
* Negresco Ristorante Pizzeria ($$) Not the best location/views but the food was amazing. It was a cold rainy day and we tucked in here for lunch. They had heaters on the patio and the food/service was great. Very good wines. Very good Pizza!

**Dinner** 

* Osteria Del Rione ($) - Recommended and set up by our BNB host. One of our favourite experiences of the entire trip. Service (10/10), Food (10/10), housewine (10/10), homemade GRAPPA (10/10 but strong lol) Tiramisu (1000/10)  - *requires reservation* 
* Cave Canem Trattoria ($) - We walked in but waited 10-20 minutes for a table. Great atmosphere, full of locals. I really liked a side dish a lot of Italians were eating called Chicory; similar to collard greens and we had a phenomenal ravioli from here. This is in the Trastevere District, known for its nightlife. There are bridges across the Tiber that people like to drink on. The area was quite full of young drunk people lol. 
* Pizzium - ($$) - This pizza was so good. We just walked in and they seated us right away. Great atmosphere. There was a front room and a back room, I personally liked the back room atmosphere more, though we were placed in the front. If I were to go back, I would ask for the back. You can get a big ball of Buffalo mozzarella right on your pizza, ugh. I am getting chills thinking about it. 

**What did we do in Rome?**  
**-** The obvious things of walking around checking off tourist destinations (Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Vatican, the many Piazzas). 

* Walking through the parks and along the Tiber. 
* Stop into little wine bars/restaurants for a glass of wine or cafe.
* If doing the Vatican or sight seeing, try to plan not on weekends or during peak periods.  
* Walking into random churches - the Churches throughout Italy are GORGEOUS. We are not religious people but they were just as good as any museum I have ever been in and most are free and open to the public. There often is a dress code though. (Can't show too much skin)
* We really loved just walking around the city. I think we walked a total of 35-50km in two days but we really got to see what life was like in Rome. 

**Florence (3 nights)**  
We stayed at an AirBNB[ ](https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/15768991)right in the friggin heart of the tourist area (District 1). Little did we know it was above one of the highest rated sandwich shops in Italy. Line ups were down the street everyday! The rooftop patio at our AirBNB was amazing and my favourite place to chill with some meat, cheese, fruits, and of course wine. The apartment's amenities kind of sucked and it was difficult to cook as the fuse kept blowing from using the stovetop but the location and views are stunning. Also be aware that there are two different colour codes for addresses in Florence (we were very confused at first when we showed up at the right address but wrong building). Generally, red addresses are for businesses and black are for residences.

**Where did we eat in Florence?** Florence is known for their steak, leather products, and of course Tuscan wines. We cooked a lot of our own meals in Florence for dinner but ate lunch on the move while walking around the city. The affordable grocery store chain in Italy is Conad City.

**Lunch**

All'antico Vinaio ($) - This place is so popular there are three locations on the one street alone. It was very good but you need to grab it before the lunch hour rush. 

La Nicchietta in Calimaruzza Sandwich Shop ($) - Another sandwich shop that we were just grabbing as we walked around the city. Great sandwich and the owner was really nice. 

Pitti Express ($) - We *LOVED* this place. Went in and sat down, enjoyed some wine. It's another sandwich shop but they have a lot more on the menu. We got a platter of cooked eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini to start and some sandwiches. The food was really good. Staff were very nice and were joking around with us and trying to teach us Italian. We just walked in, it wasn't too busy. 

**Dinner**- The only dinner we ate out was our fancy meal for my wife's birthday. It is outside of Florence (Fiesole) and can be difficult to get to. You will need to use a taxi or uber service to get out there.

* Risorante La Reggia Degli Etruschi ($$$$) - Set menu depending on what is in season. Reservation Required. Such an amazing view from both inside the restaurant and on the patio, you need to request a location with a view. Highly recommend booking to be there for sunset. Such an amazing experience and meal. Never been so full in my life. For the love of god, only order one bottle of wine. 

**What did we do in Florence?** 

* Once again, a big plan of our trip was to not have many plans. We loved just walking around the city and experiencing the lifestyle there. Popping into little shops and wine bars.
* We visited the Giardino di Boboli and spent the day walking around. It's very very beautiful, peaceful, and quiet. Being a birder, it was FULL of birds. We brought in snacks and some wine and sat in the park for a picnic. It does cost to enter the park but it is not much. There are smaller local parks nearby to chill in as well. Also has the nearby Pitti Palace (Museum)
* The museum with the statue of David is in Florence, though we opted to not see it. 
* Visiting the Cathedral of Santa Maria Del Fiore during day and nighttime is awesome. Definitely recommend going inside as well, it is insanely beautiful. The Basilica of Santa Croce is also nearby and is very beautiful both day and night as well. Churches in Italy are just next level, inside and out. 
* After the roads have quieted down (night time after a few drinks), we rented the little e-scooters and zipped around throughout the night. There's multiple companies but we used Ridemovi Scooters. It was so much fun and allows you to zoom all over the city. You are charged by mileage though, keep in mind!
* We were feeling a little homesick and found an Irish Pub to enjoy a pint of Guinness. Cool atmosphere with soccer and fired up fans lol. 

**Bologna/Modena/Parma (3 nights)** Being mid trip, we decided to get a cheaper AirBNB for the Bologna region but it was clean, quiet, and the host was really nice and helpful. The location was alright in that everything was close including the train station, but generally in Italy the areas close to the train stations are a little more rough. 

**Where did we eat in Bologna/Modena/Parma?** The Emilia-Romagna region of Italy is known as the food capital of Italy. Famous for Bolognese, Tortellini, Lasagna, famous meats like Mortadella and Parma Ham, Balsamic Vinegar, and Parmigiano Reggiano. The cheese and salted meats here are everywhere and incredible. Do as I did and make yourself sick of salted meat and cheese. I will admit that we ate McDonalds for the first time on our trip in Bologna on a particularly rainy, cold day where we needed some homey comforts. 

There's a popular dish in the area that is a pumpkin or squash tortellini with a parmesan sauce, holy shit get this. 

**Lunch**

* Bologna - Osteria Angolo Degli Orefici ($$$) In the heart of the touristy part of town so it was kind of expensive but the food was great nonetheless. This is where I had my first squash tortellini, it was so good. 

**Dinner**

* Parma - Trattoria Corrieri ($$) - Highly recommended. We really enjoyed this place, service was one of the worst we had in Italy but the food made up for it. Great atmosphere. Definitely want to eat multiple courses here. Get the cheese platter with the local honey (sounds weird but it was the most amazing and unique honey I have ever had.) Tortellini is very good. They give you this crappy bread to start, just ignore it. Everyone else orders this light fluffy bread, try to get some of that. - requires reservation

**GELATO!**

* The best Gelato we had was in Parma - Gelateria La Golosa - Pistachio Gelato is the best thing ever. 

**What did we do in Bologna/Modena/Parma?**

* As always, walking around and popping into little shops, cafes, restaurants, and wine bars. There is a super cool market area full of seafood, cheeses, meats, pastas, just everything. We went to the coolest store called Ancient Aguzzeria Horse and bought some brass pasta tools. Really cool shop! 
* Visited the sites and churches: Basilica of San Domenico, Piazza Maggiore, The Two Towers (unrelated to LOTR), and just enjoyed all of the covered granite walkways around the city of Bologna. We did not visit Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca but it was highly recommended by our taxi.
* Checked out the photo op location called ""Small Venice"". There wasn't any water but it may be different at different times of the year. 
* We loved the town of Parma. We spent the day walking along the river and around the city and wished we stayed there instead of Bologna. Travel between Parma and Bologna is SUPER easy and trains run pretty late. The Omio app referenced is great for this. 
* BALSAMIC TOUR! Cannot recommend this enough, it was really hard to get to but was so much fun and such an amazing experience. Acetaia Cavedoni. You can book it through the Viator app. They provide you with some food, cheese, wine, and of course balsamic vinegar. Get ready to spend some money on buying balsamic though! It is far outside of Modena so you need to take trains and a bus or taxi. We tried to take the bus but we missed it. If you take the bus, buy tickets at the bus station in the convenience store and ask them where the bus loads. Apparently it's the only bus that doesn't load at the terminal but instead is in the parking lot. Down the street (literally walking distance) from the Balsamic tour is a place to buy Parmesan and/or get a Parmesan tour. It's so good, buy more than one brick. Heads up though, they speak very little english. 

**Cinque Terre (Six Nights)**

My friends were not travelling to this region so I left this out but my wife and I finished our trip with Six days in Cinque Terre and it was incredible. Hiking between the towns or just taking the trains between them is a ton of fun. Relaxing on the beaches with wine and lunch was a fantastic way to end our trip. We cooked for ourselves almost every night but I understand there are lots of restaurants around. Corniglia was our favourite town because it was much more quiet - the swimming area is harder to get to but was very private and quiet.

The most ***MASSIVE SHOUTOUT IN THE WORLD*** to Bar Il Gabbiano between Corniglia and Vernazza. Our AirBNB was near here and we became good friends with the owners of the bar. We visited every day and hung out by the window chatting with hikers passing through dying of thirst. We met so many amazing people at this bar and this place/the owners were truly a highlight to the entire trip.

Sorry this section isn't as detailed as the others but I think this is long enough.

ItalyTravel,"I'm asking this as someone who lives in a very touristic town in Italy (Pisa) and has been seeing a lot of tourists from places like England and Holland really suffering from the heat. If you are someone who is considering visiting Italy, sometime in the near future, has hearing about (or experiencing) the increasingly hotter summers (which make it hard to move around outside during the day) had any impact on if, when, and where you want to go -- or does the heat not put you off at all?   
  
There has been a massive increase in tourists since COVID, but my impression is that at some point the heat will begin to put people off visiting during what is traditionally peak season (I don't see a lot of investment in infrastructure that can help visitors deal with the heat either, especially when it comes to public transport).

When I was planning my trip to Italy, this subreddit was such a lifesaver with all the amazing advice and tips I got from fellow travelers—it made a huge difference in my experience! After seeing someone else do an AMA recently, I thought it’d be fun to do the same and contribute to the community :)

I’m the kind of person who goes all out with research and planning for trips, and I documented so much during my time there, so I’ve got lots of resources, advice, and insights to share! I just got back from an almost 2-week trip through Rome, Florence, Venice (also went to the nearby island Murano), and Cinque Terre with my family (3 of us total) and I’d love to help anyone who’s planning their own trip.

Feel free to ask me anything—whether it’s about transportation, where to stay, must-see spots, packing tips, my recommendations, or anything you can possibly think of. I’m happy to chat and relive my favorite moments along the way!

ItalyTravel,"On the last day of our Italy trip, my husband and I took the direct Trenitalia train from Rome Termini to Fiumicino Airport. There was apparently some kind of fire on the tracks so the train had stopped for a few minutes and then stopped at a nearby regional station.

Everyone was confused and there wasn't much information being shared in English. But essentially, the train had all the passengers exit the train and left everyone to fend for themselves to get to the airport.

It was a pretty ridiuclous experience, especially with something so time-sensitive as getting to the airport to catch a flight. Luckily, we had plenty of time before we had to start boarding but many of the other passengers weren't so lucky. My husband and I waited about 45 minutes until an Uber finally was available to get us from the side of the highway (literally).

So my quesiton is: has anyone experienced this and is there any way to get compensation from Trenitalia for this? Not only did they not fulfill the service to get us to the airport, I had to spend an extra 60 EUR to get an uber.

TLDR; Train to airport dumped us at a regional station and we had to wait 45 minutes to get an Uber.

ItalyTravel,"I just finished 3 weeks around Italy, and for almost the entire time I was not asked by police to check my passport. Between stays I'd obviously have it on me as I had all my stuff, but I'd also do day trips by train sometimes and have my passport locked up at my accommodation and just a photocopy on me. 

Only in my last few days in Italy I took two trains and on both rides the police walked through while in transport and asked for everybody's ID. These were both regional trains with few people on it, not busy fast trains. One was Bologna-Venice and the other Venice-Trieste. Luckily I was between stays so I had my passport with me but like I said, I've sometimes been on trains this trip without it.

I don't know what would have happened if I didn't have it or even just had a photocopy because both times the police scanned my passport and flipped through to check my visa. Just wanted to post this as a warning to others that they do indeed randomly check sometimes, since I was a little unsure based on other advice on this thread and up until the very end hadn't been checked.

My mate signaled to me and took a subtle video of the pickpocket attempting to reach into my pocket before I grabbed the guy and restrained him, took him onto the street and found a police officer. We showed him the video and the pickpocket got put into the cop car, not sure what happened next.

Got me thinking, as we were very aware of pickpockets before visiting and I knew beforehand if I caught one I wasn’t going to let it slide because I HATE thieves, especially those stealing from the general public/tourists. If we hadn’t had proof and the pickpocket had fought back more than he had, to the point that it became a fight, to what point am I protected by law. According to what I’ve read, I may use reasonable force to retrieve my property or protect it from being stolen, but if I have already prevented that, how can I hold a pickpocket accountable legal-wise?

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone, I'm 17 years and I was born and raised in Naples, Italy. 
Since 2022, Naples has been chosen as a holiday destination by an increasingly large number of people from all around the world, attracted by its culinary tradition, breathtaking views and authenticity. 
I'd be an hypocrite if I claimed to love my city but ignored its main problem : filth. I've stumbled upon some comments and trip reports from a number of visitors who, when in Naples, got shocked and disgusted by littered streets, bins overflowing with trash and graffiti well displayed on ancient walls and ruins. And, as a neapolitan myself, I couldn't be more distraught and horrified. And I couldn't agree more with all the complaints...
I'm deeply sorry for how some areas of this wonderful city are neglected and ignored by the government and how some locals continually destroys the image of their own city.
However, I feel like I want my Naples to be better understood and I want its bad reputation to be washed away.
Here's my list of suggestions for new tourists willing to visit Naples in the future :

ACCOMODATION:

Areas to avoid :

-AVOID the central station. It's a public mess, filled with homelessness and indecency, trafficked and smelly. 

-AVOID Rione Sanità and Quartieri Spagnoli

-AVOID the areas at the city's borders. 

Where to stay :

-book a hotel/BnB near CHIAIA, VOMERO or POSILLIPO. These are the wealthiest, best-preserved neighbourhoods in the city. The streets are clean and nothing dangerous ever occurs there. Plus, Posillipo has the best sea in the central city, so you can cool down during a hot summer day or have a chilling stroll through Parco del Virgiliano, one of the best green areas in the city. ( if those i've mentioned are not affordable, try to look for an accomodation near VIA TOLEDO or MERGELLINA)

WHAT TO VISIT :

-explore those neighbourhoods as well, rather than spending your entire staying in the historical centre. The latter can be rather noisy, chaotic and overcrowded since the alleys are really narrow, Naples is not that only !!

- when in the centre, take the time to appreciate the beauty and history surrounding you...Naples' cathedral Duomo, Chiesa del Gesù Nuovo, San Domenico Maggiore, Monastero di Santa Chiara (what a real gem!), Spaccanapoli, via San Gregorio Armeno. These are part of a UNESCO world heritage site ! Don't forget to go to SAN SEVERO's chapel, where you'll see probably the most majestic and stunning sculpture ever made : the veiled Christ (made by a Neapolitan artist !!)
Some alleyways are a bit sketchy and gritty, and I suggest to avoid them at night, as well as Quartieri Spagnoli, which are nothing special to me.

- check out the most amazing architecture across via Toledo, Piazza Trieste e Trento, piazza del Plebiscito. These eventful, lively and picturesque spots are easy to explore and very safe for solo travellers as well. And don't forget to enjoy the street food!

-have a nice stroll at Lungomare di Mergellina, known as via Francesco Caracciolo. Naples' seafront is unique and unrivalled, it's really extensive and it's perfect for pedestrians. Watching the sunset there is a heavenly experience.

-visit the largest green park in the city, just a little smaller than Central Park !!! : Real bosco di Capodimonte. There's a spectacular museum within it showcasing amazing history and splendid works of art.

-spend some time in the upper part of the city : go to Castel Sant'Elmo and Certosa di San Martino. If you're an art addict, you'll be deeply amazed. Plus, the views are worth the strenuous climb :) 

-from Posillipo, go to Le tredici scese di Sant'Antonio, you'll be gobsmacked at the spectacular view !! 

WHAT TO EAT :

-DON'T go to L'antica pizzeria da Michele ! It might be the most famous pizzeria in the world, but it doesn't serve the best neapolitan pizza. Instead, stop at 50 Kalò, Diego Vitagliano pizzeria, Di Matteo, la Notizia.

-Don't miss out on Naples' streetfood and typical dishes : try frittatine di pasta, crocchè, zeppoline and scagliuzzielli. Enjoy a nice serving of pasta with neapolitan ragù, or with clams and mussels !

Naples is filled with amazing cafes (bar) serving the authentic neapolitan coffe as well as delicious pastries such as sfogliatelle, babà,pastiera, cornetto ischitano and fruit tarts. Check out the splendid artistic aura of CAFFÈ GAMBRINUS near Piazza del Plebiscito, where Oscar Wilde spent most of his days in 1897!

CONCLUSION

I highly recommend not to stay in Naples as a base to get to Pompeii, Sorrento and Amalfi. They are incredibly beautiful places, but Naples is a big city, with many more things to do and attractions to see !! It's like missing on Rome because you are planning to visit Ostia.


Let's not forget that Naples has inspired traditional italian and international music (think about ""O' sole mio"", ""That's amore"", ""la Tarantella""). It is the birthplace of the greatest italian philosophers.
Intellectuals such as Goethe or Leopardi admired Naples and lived there for a period of their lives.
Naples has the most ancient roman pool in the world, the Piscina Mirabilis in Bacoli.
The Università degli studi di Napoli Federico II is the oldest public university in the world...and so on.

In conclusion, Naples is a city that offers unique and authentic experiences, and following these suggestions can help you discover its true splendor. Don’t let the criticism discourage you and give it a try!

See Naples and then die
Vedi Napoli e poi muori ""  - J.W von Goethe

ItalyTravel,"We were walking back to our hotel in Capri and we were stopped by the police who asked for our identification. Our passports are obviously safe in the hotel, so we didn’t have them on us. Luckily my husband speaks Italian and was able to explain this to them, but now we’re wondering if we should be walking around with them. It makes me nervous to do that for obvious reasons so I took a picture of them and we have our US drivers license on us. But do you all typically walk around with your passport?

We have visited Bari, Brindisi, Ostuni, Lecce, and Matera, and we love each of these places. There is so much culture, history, and beautiful architecture. It feels just as amazing as Rome but with only a fraction of the crowds.

I’m still perplexed about why Matera isn’t more well-known (I know technically Matera isn't in Puglia but it is only 1 and half hour away). It is the coolest place I've ever visited! We are hitting Alberobello tomorrow before wrapping up our visit to Monopoli. Needless to say, Puglia will be the region that we will be yearning to come back.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone, yesterday, news emerged about an Italian young man who was attacked at Milan Central Station by a group of three homeless individuals while he was walking through one of the underground tunnels connecting the station to the metro. As seen in the images in the article [here](https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/24_settembre_10/milano-studente-19enne-picchiato-e-rapinato-in-stazione-centrale-era-appena-arrivato-per-il-test-all-universita-295f3f5c-8440-4ef4-bf2a-4a9a190cfxlk.shtml), the tunnel was almost deserted.

As I often mention in response to many posts where I try to reassure you about stations in Rome or Milan in Italy, this unfortunately is a perfect example of what to avoid. Always avoid places with no one around. If possible, avoid crossing paths with homeless individuals, especially if in a group, whether outdoors or indoors. They could be drunk, delirious, etc. It's better to change your route if in doubt, especially if you're travelling alone. Always stay alert, and if you sense something off, change your path.

ItalyTravel,"Was it a memorable trip. We did a day trip to Rome and saw all the major attractions. However, the memories and experiences, that will stay with me the longest, is undoubtly the trips we made to Sutri, Caprarola and Viterbo. It was mind boggling the amount of history and architecture packed into these beautiful and relatively small cities. When visiting Caprarola, we sat down at Trattoria del Cimino dal 1895 for lunch and was blown away by the level of service and the quality of the food. We came back the following day for a full course dinner and it just kept getting better.

ItalyTravel,"I've always dreamed of visiting Venice and am happy to report that it was every bit as magical as I'd hoped for. I've got my share of mosquito bites and my feet are killing me, but I couldn't be happier. I've been on a solo trip for four nights and have had the time of my life. 


This is my first time in Italy and I already feel confident in saying that Venice is one of the greatest cities I've ever been to - it's going to be hard for Florence and Rome to beat it. A few tips and tricks below:


1. Is Venice touristy? You bet it is! But the wonderful thing is that it's incredibly easy to escape the tourists - you can walk alone alongside deserted canals or stumble across squares frequented by locals as long as you're not afraid of getting very lost. Despite what some people say, there are absolutely locals here and there are areas you can go where you'll pretty much only hear Italian spoken. It's only Italian Disneyland if you stick to the main arteries and most famous sites. 


2. St Mark's Square is beautiful but it was probably my least favourite part of the city, as it's total tourist Mecca. It was heaving and as soon as I got there I wanted to get out again. By contrast, my favourite experiences were almost all happy accidents in entirely different parts of the city.


3. I don't like planning or making detailed itineraries, so didn't book a single attraction in advance. This gave me maximal freedom to do things spontaneously as and when I happened across interesting places. I'm happy with my choice and am almost regretting pre-booking a few attractions in Florence and Rome. 


4. The vaporetto is a must! I got a 24 hour pass and went to Burano and Torcello, and both were well worth the excursion - the mosaics at the church in Torcello are spectacular. I also did some riding on the A line along the Grand Canal - you've got to hustle your way to the outside area if you can, as it's a wonderful way to see the city. Note that Google Maps is very poor at route planning using the vaparetto, and often told me to walk when the vaparetto would have been much more efficient. You have to use your head and figure out the best route for yourself.


5. I had expected to pay for pretty much every attraction I went to in Venice, not counting on the fact that there are dozens of free pavilions to visit for the Bienalle (!!!), which are scattered all over the city. You have to have some level of tolerance for modern art, but if you have even a passing interest you need to try at least some of them. I stumbled across all the pavilions I went to in my travels by happy accident and saw loads of incredible art - my favourite was an interactive exhibit from Azerbaijan that incorporated a video game. Other excellent pavilions were in beautiful settings - a deconsecrated church and a typically private palazzo among them.


6. I'm a huge film fan and one of my favourites is Don't Look Now, which was largely filmed in Venice. A really fun part of the trip was tracking down locations from the film in the present - it took me up little alleys and districts I wouldn't have ventured into otherwise. It's a great strategy for exploring if you're a film nerd.


7. All of the best food I had in Venice was casual - the sit down places I tried were mediocre in quality despite great reviews. Particular shout out to Baci & Pasta, which made exceptional fresh gnocchi and sauces to die for, as well as an excellent tiramisu - it was so good I went twice for the great value meal deals.


8. I strongly recommend staying in one of the more outlying districts (I stayed in the south west, near the bus station), as it encourages more exploration and will give you insights into areas you'd otherwise never venture into.

ItalyTravel,"I'm a regular contributor on this community. Every so once in a while you get someone asking what's hype and what's real. I, due to my job, am also a frequent contributor on Instagram so I'm hammered by Italy travel and food posts all day, everyday. I'm also a trained travel agent graduated 2001 so I've been around I suppose. I'd like your opinion.

 I literally have visited every part of this beautiful country except Sardegna and Friuli. Hype is real and it's getting worse and worse. Throw AI into the mix and travelling paid influencers and soon it's going to be a trash mass tourism marketplace.

 It kind of already was and it attracts the worst of society and astronomical hotel rates. Basically if we don't learn to take a step away from the basic Rick Steves itinerary I.e. Milan- Lake Como - Venice- Cinque Terre '- Florence - Rome- Sorrento/Amalfi we're going to make these places unaffordable. 

I promise the future holds: 

- less Airbnb
- less local boutiques and restaurants 

- more 5 star hotels
- more regulation and fees
- more trash tourist restaurants
- more souvenirs made in China
- higher hotel rates

And it's already happening, I've never in my life seen hotel rates as high as this year 😳 I've never seen so many people doing this exact itinerary. 

I thought 'we' were on the right track before Covid, we were doing more to get people off the beaten track going to places like Bologna, Puglia, Matera but right now I'm afraid for Italy.

ItalyTravel,"We took the night train from Naples to Palermo on the first. Because the train schedule had changed from 2306 to 2237 we were advised to be at the station by 2200. As we were sitting near the Arrivals/Departures overhead board a guy came from our blindside and lifted my backpack off my rolling suitcase. I didn’t notice a thing but my husband caught him out of the corner of his eye and let me know. I jumped up and ran after the dude, late 20s yelling for him to give my backpack (light lilac in color so hard to claim as his.) He turned to run and thought better of it lowering his arm so I could grab it from him. I called him a few names before walking back to our seats and other luggage. 

It must have been a funny site because three grandfather types struck up a conversation with my husband, laughing about a 69 year-old woman with heels chasing a young man down in the station. If it had been even a half hour earlier the station would have been remaining with people and he might have gotten away. 

The thing is I totally bought into reports of pickpockets and unsafe conditions at airports and train stations leading me to over-pack and I had gear with me to lock or latch the bag to the suitcase. There was even a strap I could have (and have since) used already hanging off the backpack handle. Three weeks of nothing happening made me lax. 

EDIT: For those asking why my husband didn’t call out to the would-be thief or why he didn’t give chase, he was blocked in by his luggage and seeing the guy walking away with my backpack caught him by surprise plus he didn’t have a direct view of my suitcase which I had parked to the side of my chair. 

Why didn’t *he* give chase or call out to the thief? He was blocked in and I wasn’t. He wasn’t positive it was my bag, he was checking with me when I reacted and gave chase. It was a short chase. If he had called out the man would have had more time to react, so it all worked out.

Didn't get scammed anywhere. Keep your wits on you that's all. The weather in August was completely hyped up and I was terrified before going. Guess what - it rained in Rome on our second day and the weather cooled down considerably. So Yay for that as well.  Venice was super duper hot - the only place in Italy where the heat was unbearable.

ItalyTravel,"We were very fortunate to spend 8 incredible days in an incredible country - Italy was truly an amazing experience - but there are a few things I think are important to point out:

1. As everyone says, prebook everything - even in February lines were long to every ticketed attraction, especially in Rome. Late mornings often had the worst lines (9-10am) when all the tour groups would assemble and stretch the queues. Most cathedrals cannot be prebooked so you may wait in a long line to enter if there is security (we waited 1 hr each to enter St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican & Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence). EDIT: as others have said, booking tours will reduce waiting time but costs a bit more since cathedrals are usually free to enter. 
2. Rainy days, while an inconvenience to walk around, thinned out the crowds significantly. We got great shots of the Trevi fountain in Rome, for example, on a pouring day when there was plenty of room to walk around.
3. Always validate your bus tickets immediately upon boarding. Buy tickets before boarding at a nearby tabacchi (convenience store) - buses may run out of tickets as the day goes on, and you will still be fined even if the bus has run out of tickets. We were warned several times so we did this diligently, and we were checked twice on the trip and observed lots of angry tourists unaware of the rules who were fined. Even if the bus driver says free, you still need a paid ticket that is validated. If the inspector hops on the bus, he/she will not care.
4. For buses, validation is via a machine on the bus that stamps your ticket. In Rome, the validation machines are at the back of the bus (the bus driver opens all doors so just enter at the back). Rome now also has tap-and-go machines at the front of the bus for contactless payments if you don't want to buy a physical ticket. Note that for Rome tickets include bus-to-bus but not bus-to-train transfers so you will need to buy more tickets if you're taking the bus to subway. In Florence, they don't have contactless yet so the ticket validation machine is at the front of the bus. The inspector will ask to see your bus ticket to verify it has been stamped (in all cities) or check your CC if you use contactless (in Rome only).
5. In Venice, if you are taking the bus from Piazzale Roma to Marco Polo airport, be sure to check whether your bus is on ATVO (nonstop #35) or ACTV (with stops #5). We bought our airport bus tickets at the vaporetti vending machines only to be told later that we had bought tickets to the wrong bus line (vaporetti machines only sell ACTV tickets) and had to pay on the spot in cash to board the bus to make our early morning flight.",t2_30twcpk9,"A few tips from 8 days in Italy: Rome, Florence, Venice",0.97,84,1708291471.0,1708291471.0,21,dhou25,1au5b2u

ItalyTravel,"My passport was damaged while in Rome and I had to get an emergency passport from the US Embassy. My wife and I spent a lot of time on here and on FB trying to find some information regarding the process but couldn’t find anything specific, so I figured I’d detail the experience for future travelers. I also spoke to a couple others whose passports were lost/stolen so this applies to those scenarios as well.  


This applies to the US Embassy in Rome so YMMV with the consulates in Milan, Florence, or Naples. 


Things you will need readily available: 

-a method of payment, IMPORTANT: if paying by credit card, the card holder must be present, I paid for another person because they had their family member’s, who was at the airport, card 

-a government issued form of ID; DL, old passport, etc. This is not 100% necessary but saves time

-all the information you would need to get a passport; this is to fill out form DS-11

-if you are leaving soon, have your itinerary ready; the person mentioned above was able to make their flight home at 1230 because they had the flight info ready

*you do NOT need a passport photo, nor DS-11 done in advance, though this may speed things along. It only took me 5 minutes to fill out the form and there was no queue for the Photo Booth inside. 

THE PROCESS

 -The embassy is open 08:30-12:30 M-F, and closed on most holidays in Italy. You can call them during the day and they will answer most of your questions and tell you want you need. I would advise getting there by 0800 at the latest as a queue does form. Just prior to opening, they will open the security lines, separating between US and non-US citizens.  


-I was the 2nd US citizen in line needing a passport out of a total of 3 for that day. The security officers will ask about your business there before getting you ready to enter the building. They will ask you to turn off all electronics and either place them in a bag or in a clear plastic one they provided. My wife held onto my stuff for me so I only had my payment method and my damaged passport. Everyone gets moved into a security room, one at a time, and you are given a locker for your personal items. Once you pass the metal detector you will enter the building and head upstairs. From arrival to getting into the building was approx 50 minutes (0800-0850). 


-the upstairs is like a DMV; there’s a kiosk and you enter why you are there and it prints a ticket. You’ll be called to a window and you’ll need to answer some questions. *If you have a flight to catch you’ll want to tell them now* They will direct you to the computers in the room to complete the necessary form with instructions at each computer. After you are done, you’ll be called back up with instructions to pay and get your photo taken, if you don’t have one already. The emergency passport costs $165 USD and the photo an additional 6€. Return your photo and receipt of payment to the window and they will process your application. For those needing to catch a flight, they will ask you for the itinerary. They have an email you can send it to but you’ll need to go back through security to retrieve your phone, turn it on and send it, then go back through security. 


-Now you’ll need to wait as the application is processed and they confirm your information. Once done, they’ll call you back up for your “interview” which is just swearing all the information you have provided is correct. This is the last step. From entering the building to the end of my interview took approx 1 hour 40, 0850-1030. 


-I was advised to return at 1500 to pick up my passport. They did not let me back in until exactly 1500, and the same security rules applied, but I was in and out by 1510. As stated earlier, they may be done sooner in emergency situations. *there are a few EU countries which do not allow you to enter on an emergency passport, France, Belgium, Monaco, and the Netherlands. They will tell you this and there’s a sign as well.

ItalyTravel,"EDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments!
To sum it up, I realized that the reason behind this could have simply been my kinda poor Italian in a touristic area. So they switched to English to not waste the time while taking food orders and to help understand each other correctly.
Plus I don’t sound nor look Italian at all so it was easy to assume that international language (english) would just work better in some situations (especially restaurants and bars)

Also wanted to add that I did not find it rude or did not want to ’train my Italian on them’, I guess I just got a little too excited to speak a new language in its natural habitat haha
I like the process of learning Italian and will surely try to improve till the next trip!


Just came back from Sardinia. I have been learning Italian long time ago at school for few years and also recently i started learning that language again just for fun.
Also I am not a native English speaker.


Whenever I’ve been to a restaurant, shop or a bar I was thrilled to start a conversation in Italian. So many times they responded in english.
I mean, I know i am not THAT good in italian and i don’t have an accent and i indeed look as a foreigner but have been learning it ltalian, well, in fact for years now and ordering food or shopping is not a problem for me. 
Whole situation made me feel so embarrased, like that one time I was so stubborn that I even continued ordering food in Italian and the waiter again answered in english.


Is it a thing that Italians don’t like it when foreigners try to speak Italian and are annoyed by it?

ItalyTravel,"So I just came back from a short vacation in Italy ( one week and a half) and, if this can help anyone in making their mind on where to spend some time there, here is my experience, in short.

*Rome ( 2 days)

I stayed in Rome for 2 days, I found an airbnb in Trastevere. It was my forth time in Rome so this time I just wanted to experience something different than museums and historical places. Exactly in my airbnb building there was a restaurant/ bar / caffé where I had the cheapest breakfast ever: 1.50 Eu a cappuccino and 1.50 Eu any pastry ( it happens that that's exactly what I eat for breakfast, so don't judge. Back in Canada, this would have cost me 10 to 14 $ TX included....). The neighborhood was pretty, clean, animated. I was disappointed that I couldn't find a sushi poke place to eat, because I am not a great fan of pizza and pasta 🤷‍♀️ The location was great, being at walking distance ( 15 to 45 min) of old city attractions and the Bitanical Garden ( which is great to visit if you want to relax in the nature). When I left to go to the train station, I had to take a taxi ( 12 euro) because the bus was packed. Didn't experience any pickpocketing and I wasn't scammed either. The merchands were very honest and the street merchants always agreed to sell me the souvenirs cheaper after negotiating with them ( ex: bought 2 soccer t-shirts and a soccer figurine for my boys for 50 euro instead of 85). 

*Naples ( 2 days)

In my 3rd day I took the train to Naples, where I spent another 2 days.  I booked an airbnb in the Old Town and the host pucked me up from the Train station ( a shuttle service that cost 10 euro). Initial though when we arrived at the "" Palazzo"" and got off the car was: "" omg, what did I think, I am going to be killed here"". The building was dark and creepy and there was laundry hanging everywhere. Once I entered the appartment, I started to relax, everything was clean, and the host was really nice. During the next 2 days I walked around, wandering in the city, around 20 000 steps every day. I went by myself to the port and back and the narrow streets were mostly empty and never had a feeling of not being safe. I also walked one evening, with a friend, from the Old Town to the Spanish Quarter where the Maradona Mural is, and I started to appreciate the architecrural diversity of Naples with its vibrant street life ( even late in the night till early in the morning) and friendly locals. I eat there the best Tiramisu I ever had in my life. Becayse I couldn't find a place where to eat a Cesar salad 😅 I gave a try to a local pizza and loved it. For me, Naples was a nice discovery and experience. And because it was such a shirt stay, I promised myself to come back for at least one week next time. 

* Amalfi coast ( Meta di Sorrento, Capri, Positano, Amalfi - one week)

From Naples my trip continued to the Amalfi Coast, where I stayed one week. I hesitated a long time before I chose my airbnb. I knew I wanted to visit Sorrento, Positano and Amalfi, because I stopped there a couple of hours on another trip and loved it. But I also wanted a place where I can go by foot at the beach, with a nice,  soft sand. So I chose an airbnb in Meta di Sorrento, and omg I am so glad I made this choice. First, Meta it's a cute, little town, with the nicest beach between all the other places on the Amalfi Coast. My place was literally at 5 minutes walk from the beach snd I could see the sea from my balcony. My host was amazing, provided breakfast, water, coffee, juice and changed towels every day and the price was less than what I was used to in Canada. During my stay in Meta I booked a boat tour with the local agency ( 60 euro) to Capri ( one day) and Amalfi and Positano ( another day). I also visited Sorrento by myself in another day. My impressions : the island of Capri: way overrated, the streets were so narrow that I couldn't go to deep into the town and visit. The food, expensive and tasteless ( seafood restaurant, where I also had to pay an extra fees because I eat at a table?!!) and the beach - rocky, small and crowded.  It's not a place I am going to visit again.
Positano and Amalfi - my favorite places, especially Amalfi. I already knew Positano from a previous trip, so this time I spent less time visiting. Their pebble beach was the most crowded, so not a fan of it. Amalfi though, what a picturesque little town. I loved walking on their streets full of local art and buying some souvenirs. 
Overall, it was a wonderful experience that I am going to repeat, if not later this year, certainly next year. ",t2_u45w0gsm,Just came back from Italy and wow!,0.89,78,1724684002.0,1724684002.0,107,FarTransportation565,1f1q69i
ItalyTravel,"To clarify my question. 

My understanding is that the beach clubs (private beaches or bagni) in Italy may no longer oblige me to pay for a place on 'their' beaches . 

In other words if a tourist wants to put up his/her parsol and deckchair on the beach that in theory they are permitted to do that without paying a fee. 

The question is, does that include literally ALL beaches? I'm getting mixed messages about this point and can't figure it out. 

My understanding was that all beach run concessions ran out this year. I understand from a friend (who put this to the test) that if they try to kick you off you could potentially call the cops and force the owner of the beach to allow you to stay. 

What's the low down on this matter??

ItalyTravel,"Italy was amazing. My husband and I went for two weeks and had no major issues. We are M27 and M33 and both had never been to Italy before. 



**TLDR:** Believe the hype, ignore the scary posts. If you've ever been to a big city, you're prepared for any ""scary"" thing you'd find in Italy. You'll have the time of your life in Italy. 



**Stop 1: Rome (3 nights)**

*  Arrived at FCO and had no issues getting our bags or a cab, literally walked right out and waited 15 seconds. 
* Did a Colosseum/Forum tour that same day. It was amazing, we did the Underground version and we're the only group down there at the time. We're both not big into tours so the fact that we loved this three hour tour in the heat tells you all you need to know.  We brought photos of our passports and that was fine to enter. 
* Vatican (St. Peter's Dome, Cathedral, Museum) tour on Saturday (day 2). Museums were packed but our tour was more focused on the Dome/Crypt and powering through to the Sistine Chapel. We thought we'd skip ahead but stayed with the tour for the entire time (5 hours). We're not big into art but it was cool to see and got us up early in the morning. 
* Did a sunrise scooter ride around town and got amazing photos without any crowds. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the Trevi Fountain is busy at all times of the day. Even at sunrise it was fairly busy but not crazy and still enjoyable. 
* Final day we did laundry (this was a stop on a bigger trip) and shopped 
* Dinners: We went out to eat in Trastevere each night and ate around 9:30-10:30 nightly. 
* Hotel: Our hotel was Kolbe Hotel (near Forum). 



**Stop 2: Pompei (1/2 Day)** 

* Took a train from Rome to Pompeii. Weirdly enough our train went to Napoli then transferred to a bus that took people to both Pompeii and Sorrento. We were expecting this to be way more complicated but they had a person waiting at the train station and you'd have to be completely oblivious to miss it 
* Pompeii tour was cool to see. Stored our bags at the entrance next to the train station. 

  
**Stop 3: Sorrento (1 Night)** 

* Took a train from Pompeii to Sorrento
* Explored the town some and ended up getting dinner next to our hotel instead of the touristy place near the market square. My husband was upset at first since it was more scenic down near the busy market square but there were no spots open even at 10:00pm. The place we ended up eating at was certainly better food and better people. The staff was a hoot and we were so glad we ended up there
* Hotel: Grand Hotel Flora 

  
**Stop 4: Positano (3 Nights)** 

* Took a private car to Positano 
* Day 1 we explored the town, LOTS OF STAIRS, and I sweat way too damn much. For dinner we did La Sponda at 10pm and the entire place was lit up by candles only. Worth it! 
* Day 2 we rented a boat on ClickandBoat (like Turo) and had a great time exploring the coast for 4-5 hours. Jumped off a few times and swam. Did dinner down near the beach and it was meh at best 
* Day 3 we did a beach day. It costs like $40 or $50 a person to get a chair but worth it in our mind to chill and easily order drinks/food. Did dinner at our hotel
* Hotel: Hotel Eden Rock 

  
**Stop 5: Florence (2 Nights)** 

* Took a private car from Positano to Naples then a train from Naples to Florence
* We had no itinerary for sights to see in Florence and just walked around and went in places. That meant the Duomo and museums around there. 
* Must do was sunset at Plaza Michelangelo 
* The best activity we did in Florence and maybe all of Italy was a Pasta Cooking Class. It was seriously 10/10 and the food was too. 
* Had dinners at Buca Mario and Acqua Al Due (get the Pasta Sampler Flight and the Blueberry Steak). Both places seemed to be mostly locals and came recommended to us by friends who studied abroad there. 
* Hotel: Hotel Lungarno... really splurged with this one but worth every penny. 

  
**Stop 6: Tuscany/Emilia-Romagna (2 nights)**

* Rented a car from Sixt (got an Audi station wagon) 
* This part of the trip was without a doubt our favorite part of the entire trip. We planned none of it and only did what locals recommended that day. So we didn't even have a hotel booked... just went with the flow. 
* First the drive took us down SS 222 (most scenic road in Tuscany) then over to see the castle ruins of San Gimignano which was super cool. Then we drove up to Loiano where we found a villa-esque hotel on the side of the road
* In Loiano someone told us to go to the town after sunset as they were having a summer harvest festival and it was so much fun. Live music, homemade food, and no English! Luckily, Italians love talking with their hands so we were able to make do. 
* Dinner the second night was a restaurant on the side of the road, literally nothing around it and the owner/waitress/hostess apologized and was worried they didn't speak English or have English menus and when we said it was perfect she smiled so big. It made her day serving us and watching us enjoy the food. There was also a dog wandering around the restaurant which was so cute. 
* If you get the chance to do the same, we highly recommend doing this and just driving around and only asking locals what to do. No looking on google (it was tempting at times) and in the end so worth it! 
* Hotel: Palazzo Loup 



**Stop 7: Venice (1 Night)** 

* Drove from small town up to Venice. Parked in the main parking garage on the island... MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE! 
* Took a private water taxi to our hotel and it was quite the way to arrive in style! You can just ask the parking deck to call one for you. 
* We walked to all the major sights in under 90 minutes. If we had done a tour of Doge & St. Marks we would have done everything in under 3 hours. 
* Ate dinner at Osteria Alla Frasca it was a hike from our hotel but cool to see different parts of the city that were 1000% less touristy
* You can see why pickpocketing is so big here. Tight corridors and people stopping to take pictures or look at their phones. I am very good with directions (like driven coast to coast in the US without a map) and got super turned around in Venice. IMO its not a bad thing, its a good thing to just get lost and explore. Our solution was learn the way from St. Mark's Square to our hotel and anytime we got lost we just centered ourselves at St. Mark's. 
* Biggest disappointment of the trip came here... we didn't get to see the Attentione Pickpocket lady :( 
* Hotel: Sina Centurion Palace 

  
**Stop 8: Dolomites (2 Nights)**

* Drove from Venice to Dolomites. 
* Walked around the 3 towns next to us and chilled at the hotel the first day/night
* Second day we got up very early and drove up to Alpi Di Suissi for sunrise then other to see other spots. Finally we hiked up Secede Ridgeline and the views were absolutely stunning. We took the chair lifts both ways and had some beers at the top. 
* The hotel was clearly designed for chilling after skiing so the amenities were great and the pool was packed daily at like 3pm. We did the pool, hot tub, solarium, and eventually ate dinner at the hotel that night too. 
* Hotel: Alpenroyal Gran Hotel 



Overall, it was an amazing trip. Our goal was ""to Italy"" so we could explore other places in the future and ""knock out"" Italy from our list. We loved it so much we will definitely be back. Likely we'd change up some spots to see more but we don't regret seeing any of it. 

If we had to do it over in only a week, we'd probably do Rome for 3 nights, 3 nights exploring Tuscany again, and 1 night in either Positano or Cinque Terre.

ItalyTravel,"##✈️Arrival in Rome
FCO from the US - We chose to have a driver take us direct from the airport to our AirBNB, an overnight flight and managing public transportation immediately felt overwhelming. He was a highly recommended driver by fellow Rome travelers and was fantastic. I scheduled everything through WhatsApp, he was on time, very communicative and gave excellent tips for avoiding pickpockets and taxi scams plus his favorite restaurants in our neighborhood. 


•info removed at mod request 


##🏟️ROME
-Colosseum tour 830a-1130a
Book the first group tour, we used LivTours and Helena was a fantastic tour guide. She is an archaeologist and so knowledgeable. Use code MARIAHELENA10 for 10% off - she gave this to us at the end of our tour. The morning was fantastic and she planned it so we were in the shade most of the tour. Very comfortable, not too hot. 


-Attico 1210p
If you can snag these tickets, DO IT! We had the whole place to ourselves. Amazing views, photo ops along the way up and incredible scenic views with zero crowds. Tickets open up exactly 30 days prior - log on at the time (in Rome) you want the tour and try for tickets. 100% worth it! They say you have 30 minutes but no one was keeping track, we could have stayed forever up there and in the colosseum tunnels. 


-Domus Aurea 100p
Waste of time in my opinion. Zero information given in the tour but was great to escape the heat of the day. It was about 50 degrees inside so a very nice reprieve from the heat. 


-Vatican 730a
Also booked via LivTours, tour was ok. We are not catholic, nor religious. Interesting tour but long and a lot of information. Caffe Vaticano is the meeting point - excellent place to grab a caffe latte and croissant before the tour starts. 


-Heart of Rome Walk was fantastic the first full day after arrival. We went straight to the Trevi at 520/530a and walked from there to the Spanish Steps, then backtracked to Piazza Navona. We felt like we had Rome to ourselves. 


🍴Best meal we had: Rimessa Roscioli tasting dinner - words could not do this place justice. Excellent way to spend your first evening while tired from flying and also taste all of the famous Roman dishes and wine. Highly highly highly recommend. 
Other spots we ate included (in order of our favorite) Al Drago, Roma Sparita, All Antico Vinaio, Suppli and Nannarella. Oro Bistrot for rooftop aperitivo was fantastic vibes. 


🚘Transportation: I preferred Uber while in Rome. They were reliable, fast, great air conditioning and so nice. On average, they were the same price as taxis, sometimes 1-3€ more but we didn’t have to worry about being scammed with “broken meters or credit card machines”. 


📌Best overall tips: Tasting dinner at Roscioli on the evening of your arrival, wake at 445a the first full day in Rome to complete the Heart of Rome Walk (we had the Spanish steps to ourselves and about 20 people at the Trevi), early morning Colosseum and Vatican tours to avoid crowds, make reservations for dinner spots to avoid waits. 


🤍Favorite spots that felt like a secret: 


•Colossal statue of Constantine - excellent views from the park, amazing statue and close to Vittorio Emmanuel, Trajans Column, Colosseum. 


•Aventine Keyhole and Giardino Delgi Aracini 


•For pictures with the Colosseum, visit Giardino del Platani at sunset - works perfectly to walk to after the 5p Rimessa Roscioli tasting dinner. Sunset is gorgeous, vibes are great and not too crowded but incredible views. 


##🗣️Personal opinions: 
•Order Amazon bag clips to secure your purses/bags. It gave me peace of mind even though I was aware of my surroundings. 


•Skip the Pantheon, the piazza was crazy, too many people and about a 5 minute informational audio tour once inside.


•Wear comfortable sneakers and get ready to walk.

 
•Bring a water bottle - water fountains available everywhere and so nice to have water. The app Fountain Finder can give you spots on a map but they were everywhere so we didn’t need. 


•Weather was not near as hot as everyone said. Direct sun was toasty but we got out early, toured, took a break from 1-4p and then went back out. Warm but manageable in my opinion. 


•Apple Maps was great - I like that it notified me of turns and directions on my watch so I didn’t have to have my head in my phone. Citymapper was a reliable backup option with construction. 


•Construction was not as bad as shown on social media. It was there but did not interfere with seeing anything or block any views. Piazza Navona was covered up but there were other amazing fountains to view. 


##🚋TRAIN TO FLORENCE
•Prepare in advance and understand the system. Overall, the train was easy and smooth to find, enter and get to the platform BUT if you don’t know how to read the departure board, find your cart number and seat, you will need additional time. We arrived 10 minutes prior, read the board and headed to our train with about 3 minutes to spare. Purchase tickets in advance, many trains were sold out and the line to get tickets was soooo long! If you need help preparing, look at Caroline in Italy or Jenna with Italy on TikTok. They have step by step videos on how to navigate the trains that were so helpful. 


##🎨FLORENCE
-AirBNB Experiences: Cooking class & 360 views in Florence - this was amazing! So incredible, views are outstanding and a great way to meet other people on your trip. The class was so fun and food was fantastic. Highly recommend!


-Il Renaoli Boat Tour on the Arno: great way to see the river and Niccola our guide was so sweet. Slow but beautiful way to see Florence from the river under the Ponte Vecchio. 


-Brunschelli Pass to climb the Duomo: I am claustrophobic and didn’t do this but my husband and friends did and said the views are incredible! 


🍴Food: Trattoria ZaZa was incredible - make a reservation though as the wait was long without one. La Buchetta was fantastic and had such a fun dinner staff, reservation also needed. Pino’s Sandwiches was incredible - must visit! 
Osteria Belle Donne for a wine window, it is absolutely beautiful. 


🚘Transportation: We walked everywhere, extremely walkable city. From train station to VRBO near the Duomo was about a 10 minute walk. Everything is within 5-10 minutes on foot. 


💼Luggage Storage: We used Bounce before our check-in time and it was very easy. We reserved Adam’s Leather Factory and ended up getting some hot stamped leather items for souvenirs. So cute!


🏛️Accademia: Small but worth a visit. I used the Rick Steves audio guide and it was about 30 minutes total. 


🚤Boat Tour down the Arno: I Renaoli was great - Niccola was our guide and he was so sweet. Slow, easy ride down the river and back. You get to see the riverside of all the famous buildings and learn a bit about Florence. 


##🚋TRAIN TO CINQUE TERRE
Very easy to navigate - know your platform, have your tickets ready and you’ll be good to go. We did have to switch trains with a 14 minute window, it was enough time but everything was on time. We did end up leaving Florence a few hours early and wanted to get on an earlier train but could not move to an earlier train. Tickets were sold out - I would be sure that you book online in advance. The app was very easy to use and handy to avoid long lines and paper tickets. 


🚶🏼‍♀️Hiking path from Monterosso to Vernazza - started at 7:15a and passed only a few people. Beautiful views, lots of stairs but doable and fantastic viewpoint about halfway through. After the hike, we had breakfast at Vulnetia in Vernazza. It was a buffet with fruit, croissants, cappuccino, juice, focaccia, etc. It was really nice after our hike. Corniglia is the best village in my opinion - music playing, good shopping and while we didn’t eat there, it looked amazing. Bar il Gabbiano is incredible, halfway on the hiking trail between Vernazza and Corniglia. Took the train back to Monterosso afterwards. BRING A WATER BOTTLE!
*Dont forget to buy the Carta 5 Terre AD (1 for 1 day, 2 for 2 days). This is your hiking pass and a free day pass for the train. They did check our hiking passes at Corniglia. This pass will also allow you to visit Manarola and Riomaggiore later in the day via train without having to buy tickets. Purchased online through Trenitalia app. 


🚤 Boat Tour - AirBNB experience - Sunset Boat Tour with Steeven out of Riomaggiore.  Sooooo worth it. Seeing the five villages on the water is incredible. Must do in my opinion. Prosecco on board and amazing focaccia. Very cool to see the hiking path after completing it. 


🏖️Beach Day - Breakfast at Bar Pasticciera Laura, try the Monterossino cake and a chocolate croissant. Head through the old town Monterosso tunnel by 845a and get in line at Bar Bagni Eden for an umbrella and chairs. 45€ for front row, 40€ for row 2/3/4, 38€ for 5/6. You can reserve your spot for the day. We set our towels down and then hopped on the train to Manarola for the Nessun Dorma Pesto Class at 10:30a. 


🍴Nessun Dorma Pesto Class - incredible views, such a fun vibe and the food is fantastic. It’s entirely shaded with misters going so the temperature was perfect. Drinks are served along with a heavy appetizer board. Get in line outside of the “today is a good day” sign around 10. Tables along the right side rail with the best view are the way to go. It’s first come, first serve so you want to be one of the first 10-20 in line to get a table with an unobstructed view. If you’re a party of 2 or more, have one person order vegetarian so you can get a board of meat and a board of cheese to pair together. 


🚲 Bike Tour in Levanto
We rented 2 e-bikes via WhatsApp +39 0187 802511 with Cicli Raso in Levanto and biked the old train tunnels. From the train station, head to Cicli Raso. We rented 2 e-bikes. Head towards the 24 hour pharmacy (green cross and vending machine). When it splits, go left to Corsa Roma. Once at Corsa Roma, go left and it winds slightly left to the boardwalk. That’s the beginning of the bike lane. With the sea on your left, head down on the trail. It’s flat the entire ride so you can get good speed in the cool tunnels. Stop along the way for amazing views of the sea. In Bonnasola, take the slight left downhill and wrap around into town. Right after the wraparound, there is an amazing focaccia place on the left - La Focacceria (light blue sign with white awning) Get the Genovese pesto with regular focaccia for dipping and any other flavors you like. It was incredible!!!!


##🚋TRAIN TO MILAN
Levanto train station is tiny so it took little time to get through. These trains were sold out so book in advance. 


🍴 La Gioia was fantastic for a nice dinner - pricey but great food and ambience. Staff was so nice and took our group photo. 


☕️ Starbucks Reserve Roastery was a great coffee stop in the morning. There was a line outside to get in but we waited less than 5 minutes from the street. Very cool visit - they package and roast the beans while you sip your coffee. They also have several exclusive coffees available and lots of tables to sit and enjoy. We spent probably an hour here 


⛪️ We visited the Duomo exterior - it was extremely busy. From there went over to Galleria Vittorio Emmanuale. Cool to see - expensive shops, spun on the bull 3 times for good luck and left. 


🏟️ We attended an event at San Siro Stadio. Highly recommend booking the Hotel BB - San Siro if going to an event. So close, very nice staff and breakfast included the next morning. 


Overall, we didn’t do much in Milan. Lots of shopping and very urban. The AC was strong and we were grateful for that. 


##🚋TRAIN TO VARENNA
Purchased tickets in advance and got to Milano Centrale from San Siro about 30 minutes ahead of time - it’s a larger station and we also wanted to be sure we didn’t hit traffic from San Siro. 


Sit left on the train for the best views, took about an hour. Also, there was a landslide on the tracks between Milan and Varenna so we got off at the final stop - Lierna. It was a quick walk to the ferry (use Apple Maps) and get in line. It was about 20 minutes to Bellagio. 


##🛳️FERRY TO BELLAGIO
Purchase tickets in advance - there isn’t a set time tickets open on the website so check back frequently for your date. Our date was about 3 weeks in advance - https://www.navigazionelaghi.it. If it says ‘unavailable’ or none found, tickets aren’t available yet. When it is sold out, it will show you the option to add but say “online tikets are sold out”. HIGHLY recommend booking online - you can buy on board but the line was so long.


🍴Hotel Suisse was a very nice dinner option. Make reservations in advance for the rooftop deck around 7:30p. The sun went behind the mountains almost immediately and the view was outstanding. They had a live jazz band and food was good (not great) but the ambiance was 10/10. 


🍦We went left out of Hotel Suisse and found several gelato shops. Walking the empty alleys and strolling next to the lake at dusk was really beautiful. 


🚤 Como Classic Boats - boat with captain for 3 hours. Our captain was very nice and prompt. However, I would recommend renting your own boat (no boating license needed) for less money and more freedom. While you can’t dock anywhere, you can drop people off at docks and let them bridge jump or swim. Many had just found a less busy portion of the lake and all got out to swim. If I had to do it over again, I’d skip the chartered boat.  


🍴Ristoria Forma was a great lunch. They’re busy and quick but was worth it. Pizza and pasta were great! 


🛳️We took the ferry over to Varenna. The lovers promenade into town is cute. We headed to Villa Cipressi and the botanical garden. It was incredibly beautiful - so many amazing photo spots and places to sit and enjoy the lake views. We stopped on the way out - left doorway when you’re about to exit passed the desk. There a bar with great Hugo Spritz and aperitivo snacks. Gorgeous views and good cocktails. Highly recommend. 


🚘 We arranged return transportation through our hotel. He did not have contact info for this. 


##⭐️Top tips:
•Order a rechargeable pocket fan off Amazon. It’s not the heat more than the lack of airflow - in restaurants, cars, boats, etc. I could not imagine our trip without this. 


•Comfortable walking shoes - we hit 9 miles at our highest in Rome and 10 miles in Cinque Terre when we hiked. I liked the Dr Scholls Time Off with Super Feet inserts.  


•Don’t stress about your outfits - there are people wearing everything possible and you’ll fall somewhere in it. If you love a good IG photo, pack the cute outfit. If you love comfort, dress comfortably. You’ll find everything possible. 


•Do not bring a roller bag! It was miserable just watching people try to lug their suitcases up 50+ step staircases. Plan your outfits, do laundry while there and reduce to a carry on backpack. I had the Osprey Fairview Wheeled. It was awesome! Rolled through the airport and wore as a backpack up stairs. Highly recommend. 


•The weather/crowds/pickpocketing situation wasn’t as bad as it was made out to be. Dress for summer, bring a fan, drink water and accept that you’re going to sweat a little. Wake up early (also helps with crowds) and take a break from 1-4p. Stay in the shade and dress cool. It wasn’t nearly as bad as we thought it would be. Never encountered anyone shady but watched my stuff, used common sense and was aware of my surroundings. 


•Plan your days out and book things in advance and also build in margin to have Flex Time should anything happen. Italy is a lot smaller than the state I am from and it was super easy to move around via train from city to city and use Uber in cities. 


I hope you have fun and hope this helps someone.

I'm wondering if, by some miracle, I could somehow find my lost passport without filing a police report (of course, I will have to go to the embassy to report and apply for a new passport., but I think it will take a lot of time).",t2_ftup94n2,Just had car stolen in Milan.,0.84,75,1723581320.0,1723581320.0,77,Novel_Ad_9809,1erih4o

ItalyTravel,"Capri is definitely one of the most beautiful spots in all of Italy but lord almighty it was the most difficult spot to move around in. 

The amount of people (mostly tourists) on that small island was unbelievable. It was like Disneyland on steroids. 

The port area is severely crowded to the point where I witnessed multiple fights breaking out. 

The funicular transport is a complete mess. Minimal amount of spots transporting people and 100s of people queuing in the sun. People cutting lines being rude. Just be aware if you have a ferry to catch you need to leave the top of Capri (shopping area) an hour early to get down using the funicular. 

Taxi service is available but just a minimum of hour queue. Also these taxis are slow because they are navigating through the swarms of tourists. 

Keep in mind I visited in “off season”, not June July or August. Locals stated it’s even worse in those months which my mind can’t comprehend. 

TL;DR: Capri is nice, but too crowded to consider going back.

ItalyTravel,"So I just got back from a two-week trip to Italy visiting Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan. I wanted to share some places I'd recommend and tips I learned along the way to help others who may be traveling there soon.

**Rome:**

***Best Restaurant*** - Ristorante La Nuova Piazzetta

***Visit*** - Trevi Fountain (Free), Colosseum, Roman Forum, Basilica Di Santa Maria Sopra Minerva (Free), Pantheon \*book ahead\*, Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola (Free), Vatican Museums/Sistine Chapel \*book ahead\*, St. Peter's Basilica \*arrive early\* (Free).

* If you visit on the first Sunday of the month, you can get into many places free. For example, we got into the Colosseum and Roman Forum for free. Just had to pick up your free tickets right outside the Colosseum.
* You can find free water all over Italy, the fountains might not look the cleanest but drank out of them the whole time and had no issues. Even saw kids putting their mouths on them directly sadly.
* Be careful if you have never used much public transportation, google maps will direct you on which bus to go on but make sure you're on the right side of the street of where you want to be going.
* Google Translate will be your best friend, download the Italian language on it before you go so you don't need wifi to translate. Take a picture and it will translate everything for you.
* Do not take pictures in the Sistine Chapel although you will see others doing it. Bring a bandana/scarf to cover up in churches.
* Bring comfortable shoes and pain medication, your feet, legs, back, neck, everything will probably hurt - we averaged 6 miles a day walking around through cobblestone streets.
* You will be charged a service charge per person for sitting down at a restaurant.
* The elevators are sketch in Italy.
* .Always validate your train and bus tickets. Book your long-distance train tickets 30 days in advance for cheaper prices, I recommend: [https://www.omio.com/](https://www.omio.com/)
* Hot tip, if you don't want to do a wine tour, go and visit shops selling Limoncello, they practically give you unlimited free samples, we ended up leaving tipsy and also of course bought some.

**Florence:**

***Best Restaurant*** - Panetteria e Stuzzicheria De Neri \*best sandwich\* & Trattoria Za Za \*cool vibes\*

***Visit*** - Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Uffizi Gallery \*book ahead\*, Palazzo Pitti, Leonardo Interactive Museum, Statue of David \*never got to see because the line was so long, definitely book ahead\*

**Optional** - Boboli Gardens, Florence Baptistery, Santa Reparta, Duomo Museum, Officina Profumo Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella

* F\*\*\* the transportation system. We were using the tap-and-go payment method on the bus with my credit card. We tapped twice for two tickets, each time it said ""Approved"" and turned green. Ticket inspector comes on the bus, and says we only paid for one ticket. 1 card = 1 ticket. If you want to buy more than one ticket, you need SEPARATE cards. Not even sure if it's worth disputing because we want to visit again.
* Haggle with the guys in tents if you want to buy something, you can always get them lower. Initially, a pair of sunglasses was **€**25 and we got them down to **€**7. They just want your money, some will be rude to you if you walk away after showing interest.
* Saw many beggars throughout all of Italy - they would stand outside the shops you were in demanding ""Cash"" or some would just be quiet on the side of the road, and some would approach you at bus stops. Sometimes telling them ""No"" would cause them to yell ""F\*\*\* you"".
* Take a pasta-making class if you're there, was a very fun experience in my opinion, and unlimited wine. We did this one: [https://www.viator.com/tours/Florence/Cooking-Art-Brunelleschi/d519-251801P4](https://www.viator.com/tours/Florence/Cooking-Art-Brunelleschi/d519-251801P4)
* There is no A/C in many of the museums/places you will visit but they do have some small ones in certain rooms you can stand by for a few moments to cool down.
* Ninos has free samples galore and is absolutely delicious, highly recommend just a visit to try some of their treats: [https://www.instagram.com/ninoandfriendsitaly/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/ninoandfriendsitaly/?hl=en)
* Wine windows are all over Florence, I never got to use one but would highly recommend trying it out if you can
* If you don't like Aperol Spritz, get the Limoncello Spritz or Hugo Spritz.
* Keep updated on possible train strikes, we had to skip our trip to Pisa due to a strike.
* Look out for people laying art on the ground in high traffic areas, they are waiting for someone to accidentally step on one so they can demand money.
* Be on the look out for ""fake"" art. Many people selling art on the sides of the road will have a pallete out but not be painting, those people are selling prints. They are not original. You can find original artworks though, just look for someone actually working on a painting.

**Venice:**

***Best Restaurant*** - Farini

***Visit*** - Doge's Palace, Museo Correr, Rialto Bridge (Free)

**Optional** - Basilica Di San Marco

* Get the rolling venice pass: [https://www.veneziaunica.it/en/content/rolling-venice](https://www.veneziaunica.it/en/content/rolling-venice), if you buy it 30 days prior it is cheaper. Trust that it will save you time and money, just remember you have to actually \*get\* the tickets from these yellow boxes outside of the train station or certain bus stops (sometimes the box will not be working, you will have to find another box). You can only get the physical tickets the day of when the pass is meant to be active, not the day before.
* My personal favorite place we visited, I think it was the best, we went on a gondola ride and it was **€**110 for about 20-30mins. I didn't time it but it was very enjoyable as the sun was setting. S/O to Alessandro. Find yourself a good gondolier who enjoys his job. You will see many that look miserable rowing us tourists around.
* We did not expect the San Marco plaza to flood but we ended up taking off our shoes and walking barefoot to get through it, some people will be selling these rubber/plastic leg coverups for **€**5-**€**10 euro if you want to avoid it.
* Towards the end of the night those water bus taxi's get pretty busy, try to wait at the front of the dock to get on the next boat otherwise you'll be waiting for the next one.
* Avoid the same of men giving out roses as ""gifts"", they will start demanding money if you take one and they won't accept it back when you tell them you don't want to pay.

**Murano:**

* Just a tip, when trying to get to the boat for Murano. You need to walk into the train station, and keep walking on the right until you see signs directing you to the Murano boat.
* Glass on Murano was definitely more expensive than on Venice island. If you want to make sure it's real glass, look for ""Murano Glass"". You will see many items that say ""Murano Style"" these are not authentic but they may still be created in Italy. I ended up buying some of them because personally, I thought they looked the prettiest.
* I personally would not recommend visiting Murano unless you want to pay high prices for glassware. It was pretty but it was also about equally pretty on Venice island.

**Milan:**

***Best Restaurant*** - Osteria Da Fortunata

***Visit*** - Duomo di Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (Free)

* Basically Italian New York, legitimately has a ""big apple"" in front of the ""Grand Central Station"".
* Very big city like, graffiti everywhere, lots of traffic, almost felt like we were back in the states minus the giant posters of ""Armani"" advertised everywhere. Seriously the marketing budget must be insane.
* To get inside the Duomo, you had to buy a ticket but honestly had seen so many churches by then we decided to skip out. Looked beautiful outside. Right next to the Duomo is the Galleria with all the big famous brands (Prada, Louis Vuitton, etc.) I just went in to see it. Did not shop obviously.
* If you want affordable shopping in Milan, continue down from the Galleria to P. za Del Duomo and Via Torino and I would personally recommend Bershka, Pull & Bear, Primark, and Alcott.
* Get global tax form if spending more than **€**70 at a shop. Keep your passport on you to easily do this. When you go to the airport, find out where the kiosks for the tax refunds are immediately, don't be like us where we got all the way past Passport Control and Security to find out they were at the very beginning.

TLDR: Bring a waterbottle you can refill at free fountains all over Italy, bring a scarf/bandana to cover up in churches, watch out for scams art/roses, figure out public transportation before you go - always validate your ticket, book tickets ahead of time for places to avoid waiting in lines for hours, bring pain/flu medication (EU does not have easy access to much of this like the US).",t2_5gg9kb50,"The Newbie Guide to Italy - Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan",0.88,73,1726549392.0,1726549392.0,41,OriginalMyst,1fiqj7a

ItalyTravel,"Coming from Honolulu, the pace of this city mirrors Manhatten, I constantly feel like I'm in someone's way, so I go out of my way to make sure I'm not another American tourist stopping abruptly and frustrating locals.

The airport: we chose to take a taxi from the airport to reduce complexity on our way in, while the line for taxis was long mid-day, that felt like the right call.

Using my admittedly piccolo italiano, from 100 days of duolingo, I can't shake the feeling of attempting to speak like a child to the professionals we constantly come in contact with, I regularly chicken out and just speak English.  It took personal courage just to ask for the check at dinner tonight (il conto per favore), maybe they care, maybe they don't, but without a personal connection to this place to feel allowed (without a better word), I feel like a bumbling american butchering their language when I make attempts.  I knew it would feel this way. But I still do.

Looking forward to our tours tomorrow, colossuem and food tour in Travestere, for the content and just for a general head nod that we are being normal ok tourists.

All that said, Day zero here and I'm overwhelmed with the depth of history and real people living their daily lives here within it, I guess that is the big difference in Hawaii,  the locals don't overlap with tourists the way they seem to here in Rome.

Dinner at a place with laminated menus was Amazing! I get it now, fresh peccorino on pasta is the only way to live.

Not looking for advice, just my take on my first few hours here.

ItalyTravel,"Cross posted from r/italy because i think this is the actual correct place for this post 

I’ve been lost in my thoughts about this interaction please help me understand.

I’ve been here in Italy on a road trip for the past couple of weeks. But one thing has been bothering me since I arrived and stopped at an osteria in Firenze.
 
//Edited for clarity//: the building listed “Bar/Ristorante/Osteria” on its exterior

It was hot, our group of friends (4 people) was tired of walking, we saw empty tables on the street so we asked to sit for “a little bit of food and drinks.” We ordered some wine and beers, and an antipasto and after that when the waiter brought our food/drinks, we were then told with a bad attitude, that this is a restaurant and you should really order a meal. He explained the idea of a coperto to us, to which we already understood and didn’t care about (we said that was fine that we would still be charged). We also declined to order a full meal. Let me reiterate that this place was empty and we were the only customers (some came later, had small dishes like pizza and beer). 

Did the server just see us as annoying Americans (which, I get, but we were definitely being polite and trying our best to speak in Italian), or did we actually do something wrong by not ordering a meal? Was he annoyed that we were making him work? Help me understand and clarify this because the rest of my trip I’ve been questioning restaurants vs bars or cafes for a drink and an appetizer. A lot of the time I don’t want a full meal when I’m walking around your beautiful cities.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all,

Got back from my enjoyable-but-tiring 8 day trip in Italy, and wanted to give back here by listing some tips that I learned! Went to Rome, Florence, Biella, Milan, Como, and Venice. Sept 2024.

1. Train travel (a lot of this is repeating info previously stated)

* Regional Train trips (Trenitalia/Trenord) are automatically validated on your chosen trip. You can buy your tickets through [https://trenitalia.com/en](https://trenitalia.com/en) or the Trenitalia app. Ticket prices don't change.

These tickets are never sold out, but seats are not guaranteed, so come early if you can if you want the best seats.

No wifi on these IIRC. Toilets can be pretty messy.

* High speed trains (Trenitalia, Italo) don't need to be validated. Seats are guaranteed, of course, as it says so on your ticket. You can get these on the Trenitalia or Italo apps, or on https://trenitalia.com/en.

Ticket prices are dynamic. Buy them earlier if you can.

Trenitalia and Italo run promos (reaching 50% off!) if you buy a ticket a week before you're trip. Conditions being you buy 2-3 tickets, or get same day return tickets, stuff like that. Downside is, you won't be able to change the bookings if you use promos. You can check them out on their websites.

There's free wifi on the high speed trains. Cleaner toilets, but that's not a given.

* There are also 3rd party sites like Omio that sell tickets, probably at a higher cost (I never used them). Incidentally, Omio is what I used to confirm if a particular trip was a regional or high speed trip.

- This website was a godsend for giving me live updates of trains, including delays and bay numbers:

[https://www.rfi.it/en/stations/station-page/quality-services/Public-information/Live-departures-Arrivals-Monitor.html](https://www.rfi.it/en/stations/station-page/quality-services/Public-information/Live-departures-Arrivals-Monitor.html)

2. Tap to Go local travel

Can confirm this works for Rome, Milan, Florence. Used trams, subways, and buses.

Venice: the attendant told us tap to go doesn't work or Water buses, so we had to use a machine (still paid using credit card).

Como: we had to line up at the ticket booths for ferries, paid with credit card. Recommend buying online a few weeks before your scheduled trip at https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/tickets-and-timetables-lake-como/.

We had a few instances of buses skipping scheduled trips, and some train delays, both of which seem to be normal occurrences.

3. Cash / Paying

You can exchange foreign currencies at some Postal Offices.

You can withdraw using ATMs. I used a BNL machine, and it was pretty easy. Remember to decline the option to convert using local currency (something like that) when it pops up.

We paid for most things with a credit card, but it's good to have some cash with you. It's cumbersome to pay for a 1 euro bottle of water via credit card, for example.

Locals will say something costs ""5 and 4"" if they mean 5.40. (since they use commas instead of decimal points). That screwed me up a bit.

4. Safety

Almost all the places we went to were tourist spots.

We witnessed two incidents. One was a purse snatch in the Rome Metro. And the other, we saw a man in Venice trying to figure out what to do after some sort of credit card theft/scam.

Other than those, generally felt pretty safe. Like everyone says, just be alert with your surroundings and you should be okay.

Rome there were a lot of people trying to sell those friendship bracelets. But none were too forceful. Just avoid them if you see them.

Avoided elevators in stations.

I had one of those small travel bags that wrap around your chest. Phone was on a lanyard around my neck.  Whenever we had our luggage we had locks and twisties on them. Nothing valuable in my pockets.

5. Bring passport or no?

We chose not to bring our passports with us, but had photocopies and colored copies on our phones. But it does seem to be an even split here on whether to bring them. We also stayed at decent hotels, so we weren't too worried about leaving them in our rooms.

6. Language

Don't assume everyone speaks English. Better to ask ""parli inglese?"" first. Google translate isn't perfect, but will suffice.

7. Data if you don't have ESIM capability

I had to make do with the Wind Tourist sims that the Forex counters were re-selling at Malpensa Terminal 1. They were selling pairs of physical SIMs that had data and call minutes. Each of our sims had 30gb and 300 minutes , got the package for 34 euros. These are notably NOT a good deal, but I had no choice. After waiting 3 hours after purchase to install them, they DID work perfectly for our entire trip. You can check your remaining balance using the official Wind app.

If you can go to a proper Wind (or other brand) store that can get you tourist sims, then go for those. Data in Italy is pretty affordable!

8. Power sockets

Google the types of sockets they have. If you have devices with 2 round prongs, you should be okay. Advice is to bring one universal adaptor and then an extension cord so you can charge multiple things off it.

9. Special note on Lake Como area

We opted to take the regional train from Milan to Varenna, hoping to avoid larger crowds (this was on a Sunday, so we had little hope). It was the only real bad decision we made on our vacation. We had to stand both ways of the train ride. The return trip was especially tough. There were so many people, everyone worried about making the train, that there was a massive rush on the tracks when the trains came. And to top it off, out train to Milano Centrale was rerouted, so we ended up in Garibaldi, which made our journey to our accommodations more challenging.

I'm guessing that getting rides to and from Bellaggio would have been better.

Will try to add more as I remember them. Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of these!",t2_w3x5l,Italy Travel tips,0.93,69,1727963629.0,1727963629.0,28,butchmapa,1fv8aqg
ItalyTravel,"I recently had a chance to visit Milan in June and Bergamo in August for a full-day trip, thanks to RyanAir early-morning and late-night flights. For me Milan was a bit disappointment, other than the Doumo it was just a crowded and expensive city, with luxury stores, and a few interesting exhibitions, a long and expensive train trip from Airport to Downtown. On the other hand Bergamo was fantastic, not overcrowded, wonderful parks, gastronomy and the old town was amazing with its cable cars. 

Personally I think, Milan is nothing special, and overrated, especially if you are not visiting e.g. Lake Como and nearby sightseeings. ",t2_eodrrpbu,Bergamo is better daytrip than Milan,0.85,69,1723537629.0,1723537629.0,61,sipinhoo,1er2lfe

If you'll wan't to hear about rome the majority of posts can tell you detailed and beautiful things. Instead, let me draw your attention to Trieste. Oh boy, this is gem! It's located on the east side of italy bordering slovenia on one side and sea at the other.
Here you'll find Grotta Gigante, an amazing cave which you might seen in guiness records, it's huge and what makes this different from other caves is the lack of small corridors and rooms, this is one gigantic room so stunningly beautiful that my vocabulary won't do it justice. Also, it's worth mentioning it's 11 degrees celsius, so quite a nice change from the 32 celsius outside. A short busride from the caves you can see an almost 100 year old lighthouse, 'the victory lighthouse' it is still in function and one of tallest lighthouses in the world and it is absolutly stunninglly inside and out. Theres free entry to the top too! Above the dome theres a majestic statue that reminded me of the one you'll see in the series game of thrones.

ItalyTravel,"Just spent five nights in Venice, thanks for all the advice in this sub. I was with my 68 and 71 year old parents. 

Day 1: Arrived at airport in afternoon. Took the orange line Alilaguna to Rialto. Was super simple to buy the ticket at the kiosk at baggage claim. Easy walk to the boat. Got off and walked ten minutes to our airbnb. 

Went for a walk around, holy crap Rialto is busy. While it was a convenient location, I didnt care for all the retail shops. 

We went for dinner at Muro Frari, had pizza, vognole and spaghetti seppia. I was here for the marathon, so was searching for carbs first. The pizza was mediocre, the rest were passable, but the worst meal so far. 

Day 2. Bought the Museum Pass, which is a great deal for my parents with the discount rate. Walked right into Doge palace. Beautiful, and definitely worthwhile. Also went into Museo Correr which was interesting too. Had lunch at Pasta Pasta, which was better than Muro Frari. 

We bought the 3 day vaporetto pass, which is a must for exploring Venice. It was so easy to hop on and off. We must have taken over 20 trips while we were there. 

First stop was Giorgio. And we headed to the marathon expo at San Guiliano. Had dinner, more pizza at Dai Fioi, which was decent, but again below expectations (Edit. the one pizza was very burnt, the other was great). We get pretty good pizza with electric ovens in Vancouver so was a bit surprised. But its carbs and thats what I needed. 

Day 3. Went to the modern art museum, but first coffee in the beautiful cafe. The oriental museum was the best part, but Im not much of a modern arts person. 

We took the boat to Burano, and mostly walked around. Had some chichetti at Aqua Salsa, beautiful spot, decent eats, loved the baccaro? (white cod) and quiet. 

Dinner at Antico Gateleco. Fritto misto, seppia, seafood pasta were all delicious. Finally get closer to the good food. 

Day 4. Ran the Venice Marathon, which is an incredible race. Happy to share more about that. Parents cheered me on in San Marco at km41. 

Post race celebration at Cafe La Serra. Beautiful setting, decent ""toast""

We booked a ticket for the rooftop terrace, but it closed ""due to weather"" when we got there. Too bad as it was a beautiful evening. 

Dinner was at Nevodi, which was amazing. So good that we made a reservation for the next night. Our budget is in the 100 euro for 3 ppl, so we didnt seek out higher end restos. Walked around Punta della Dogana after (the vaporetto pass is so great). 

Day 5. 

Loved Museo Fortuny. Ate some tramezzino at Bar Alla Tolleta. Yum. Then a row with Row Venice, made a booking the night prior. Highly recommend for an authentic experience, we didnt want to just sit on a boat. Had some really good and cheap fritto de mare at Fried Land , hole in the wall, just perfect. We walked around some more, and then dinner again at Nevodi. No regrets. 

Day 6. 

Woke up early, walked around in the mist and caught sunrise at Accademia bridge. Wow. Had a cafe at Caffe Rosso, gelato at Suso. Walked with our rolling luggage from Rialto to the train station. They had large luggage, my mom was fine but I swapped my carryon sized with my dad. our 72hr ticket was expired and didnt feel like paying another 9.50 each. We spent that on cichetti at Osteria al Tappo, waiting for our train in the nice courtyard. 

Walked to train station too early, i had prebooked Italo tickets, checked the signboard and got on the train. Large baggage overhead no problem, pdf of my tickets were checked onboard later. 

Next stop Bologna! Ill be there for four nights, looking forward to more exploring! Any suggestions? two day trips to Ferrara and Ravenna are the current plans before we head to Florence then Rome.",t2_b6st1np6,Venice was amazing,0.99,71,1730210026.0,1730210026.0,53,Obvious-Surround5026,1gev5zn

ItalyTravel,"I arrived in Italy on Aug 24th and had to catch a train to Naples, then a subway to my hotel. I really want to thank everyone on their pickpocket/robbery reports. I was hyper vigilant when I entered Roma Termini, Napoli Central and the subway (seeing as those were of the reported areas with high pickpocketers.) 

Well, sure enough, I get to the subway and I see a guy that seems odd.  He seemed to be eyeing people up and down, particularly ones with luggages. Then he sees me and I guess he’s picked me as a target. I definitely stood out a tourist. To test my theory, I moved to another place in on the platform. He followed me and was clearly eyeing my bag and pockets. But! Thanks to the commenters here, I just looked at him dead on and kept my eyes locked to his as he left the area. He knew the jig was up and left. When the train left, I saw him still on the platform, probably waiting for another target. 

I will say, I was worried about Napoli. I’d heard about how dangerous it was. It turns out though that the people there were so warm and friendly. I’m clearly a tourist and alone…and walking around past 11PM, nothing. My backpack and crossbody bag were safe. Everyone kept to themselves. The restaurant I went to had top notch service (granted it was Pizzeria Brandi, so they’re a tourist trap, I know). Still it was awesome. They were super attentive. Just walking around as well, each alley has its own vibe. The only thing, man are those lemon slushies expensive AF! But so damn good! A tiny cup for 3.50 Euros. I still had a few though. 

Now, it’s R&R time in Amalfi before I continue on the journey later this week. 

To everyone, thank you for all the tips and things to look out for. I’m very excited for the remainder of my vacation. ",t2_e7x64xrm,Thank you,0.92,67,1724710311.0,1724710311.0,10,Professional-Bad-559,1f20sel
ItalyTravel,"Hey again, friends. You may remember my [halftime report thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1fx09sr/ive_been_in_rome_for_over_a_week_with_one_more/?ref=share&ref_source=link) from the other week. I'm happy to share that my wife and I are fully settled back home in the States and have had a few days to reflect on our wonderful time in Italy.

I covered the fun, silly 'culture shock' material in the above-linked thread, so I'll mostly be using this one to recount our actual itinerary: where we stayed, places we went, things we did, food we ate, etc. and some (hopefully helpful) tips for first-time visitors like we were.

* Not including travel days, we essentially had 12 full days in Italy. Our home base was the **Rome Cavalieri** which was overall a very positive experience. You can read our full review of the hotel [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1g3gped/review_two_weeks_at_the_rome_cavalieri_waldorf/?).

* We gave ourselves 2-3 full days in Rome to start, just so we had enough time to fully recover from the jet lag. In those days, without any real solid plans, we hit the usual tourist spots including **Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, the Colosseum**, and more piazzas than you can shake a gelato at.

* Then, every other day, we would jump on a train and take a full day trip to towns/cities nearby. More on that shortly, but first, on Rome...

* **What an absolutely stunning city**. My wife and I agreed that of all the places we visited in Italy, Rome was our favorite place. Granted, we spent the most time there, but...the sheer number of things to do and see, places to eat, etc. just put it at the very top for us.

* On our very first night, despite being very tired from our flight, we ventured into the Trevi Fountain area. We didn't have any restaurant reservations but were starving, so we just popped into Baccano which is just around the corner from Trevi. My wife got the carbonara and I got some sort of pasta bolognese, and both were absolutely delicious. As my wife continued to work on her carbonara, an old, Italian man strolled up to our table with an accordion and started singing/playing ""That's Amore"" and it was just...an absolutely perfect, movie-esque sequence of events. My wife remarked, **""I can feel my childhood trauma leaving my body.""**

* One night, we met up with some friends for dinner in Trastevere and really loved that area, as well. Our biggest Rome-related regret is not **spending more time in Trastevere**. From what we could tell, it was much less touristy (but still a *little* touristy and still quite bustling) with some amazing restaurants. We got pizza at L'Elementare, by the way, which was the best Roman style pizza we had in Italy.

* Something I mentioned in my other thread is how **I wish I'd taken advantage of the Rome metro sooner** which still holds true. If you're not very well-versed in metro transit, please don't feel intimidated! Take a few minutes to learn how it works. Once you 'get it', the entire city will open up to you. It's very, very simple, I promise. There's essentially two main train lines - A and B - that will get you almost anywhere in Rome. They intersect almost like an X. Just understand which line you need to be on and what direction you need to be going in (what is the end destination in relation to the station you're at?), and you're good. 

* Also, the **major metro stations have tap to pay**! There were so many times when we would walk into the metro to see droves of tourists lined up by the machine to buy / refill their metro card. Don't be one of those people! Just tap your credit card onto the reader by the turnstile, wait like a half-second for the green light and doors to open up, and you're good. Just keep in mind that if you're traveling with your partner, for example, you cannot use the same credit card twice. The machine will make you wait like 15 minutes before you can use the same CC again. (It's this way in NYC too, I believe.) Ironically, a very nice Italian man had to explain this to us the first time we did it, and missed his train because of it. :( We felt really bad but were super grateful for his help.

* My most earnest recommendation for any first-time visitor to Rome: **get lost on the Metro.** Well, figuratively *lost*. At least try to get to where you're going first. But if you get lost in the process, that's OK. Look up literally anywhere you want to go in Rome and try to get there via Metro. Just do it. And if you're *truly* a directionally-challenged individual and wind up somewhere you weren't expecting, who cares? Walk around and explore a bit. Maybe you'll find a cool shop or cafe. I promise you, once you get over that fear, that proverbial hump, of learning the metro, like I said earlier, the entire city will open up to you.

* On the topic of public transit, we **never had an issue with taxis** but the only times we requested one was from our hotel, and it was called for us by our hotel concierge. So, I understand the most popular apps are FreeNow and ItTaxi, but I can't speak to any personal experience with either app. My friends used Uber a few times, but it's quite expensive. If you're wondering about cost, I feel like you can get anywhere in Rome within 20-25 minutes and it was always 18-24€.

* Lastly, I wanted to talk about trains. **Train travel in Italy is so awesome**, at least compared to Amtrak in the U.S. They're usually very clean, chairs are super comfy, and there's free Wi-Fi, and an outlet. What more could you want!

* As mentioned earlier, we did several day trips during our stay, so we rode the trains quite often, 8 times in total. My recommendation is to buy tickets in advance - at least the ticket *to* your destination. If you have a *very, very good idea* of how long you'll be there, then buy your return ticket. But just keep in mind that **train tickets will very likely be much more expensive if you buy them the day of travel.** Ex. We had prepurchased our return ticket from Naples to Rome which were 18€ per person. We had finished our itinerary for the day and just wanted to see how much tickets would be if we decided to leave a few hours earlier. Tickets that day cost *55€ per person*.

* **Navigating the train station is a cinch**. It's very similar to an airport in the sense that there will be a giant, electronic board that will show you Arrivals (""Arrivi"") and departures (""Partenze""). The most important pieces of information you need will be your train number (usually 4-5 numeral digits) + your departure time, both of which will be on your confirmation email when you buy a ticket or viewable from your Trenitalia mobile app which I HIGHLY recommend downloading. You can buy train tickets in Italy through the aforementioned Trenitalia or ItaliaRail. (I believe the former technically owns the latter, but don't quote me on that.)

* Once you're able to locate your train on the departures board, you're just waiting for the track number (""binari"") to pop up. In some of our train travel experiences, **the track number did not appear until literally 3-5 minutes before our scheduled departure time**. So, be vigilant and keep a very close eye on the boards. Once you know what track your train is on, make your way over there ASAP!

* There are two main train hubs in Rome - Roma Termini and Roma Tiburtina. I believe it's Termini that has an ""EST"" section (meaning ""east"") which is in a completely different area of the station. So, if your train is coming into ""EST 2"" it's track/binario 2 in the east section of the train station, not track/binario 2 in the main section. Understand this distinction and follow the signage.

**OK, let's talk about day trips**! In my research, my goal was to curate a list of destinations that 1.) were no farther than a 1.5-hour, one-way train ride from Rome, and 2.) offered a unique experience compared to each other. With that criteria in mind, we landed on **Tivoli, Orvieto, Ostia Antica, Naples, and Florence**. My  brief impressions and recap of each location below:

**Ostia Antica**

* I'll get this one out of the way immediately and say we didn't get to go lol. We had booked a guided English tour via GetYourGuide (which is awesome - highly recommended). We woke up bright and early and took a taxi to the meeting spot only to be greeted by our tour guide who informed us that **the tour had to be cancelled due to an unexpected public transit strike.** That meant metros and buses were not running at that time, so we couldn't even get to Ostia Antica without paying for a very expensive taxi cab ride. We felt really bad for the tour guide, because she had to stick around for the next hour and break the bad news to other would-be tour participants. However, it sounded like it would have been really cool! Especially if, like in our case, Pompeii is just little too far away for you.

**Tivoli**

* This was our first day trip, and I'm really glad that it was, because **it truly was a 'push you into the deep end of the pool' type of experience** as far as getting us out of our comfort zone as travelers. First of all, I messed up when we bought our train tickets and bought ones for ""Bagni di Tivoli"" which is actually Tivoli Terme, a very small town on the outskirts of Tivoli, about a 30-minute car ride away. Fortunately, we realized our mistake while we were still on the train and just stayed on the train for two more stops to get into Tivoli proper (shhh, don't tell anyone).

* Once we arrived in Tivoli, we tried to ask an employee at the transit station for directions, but she did not speak any English and could not be bothered to help us at all. So, we just started walking into town. There, with the help of some locals and Google Translate (lol), I was able to figure out that we needed to walk into a tobacco shop to buy bus tickets to get where we wanted to go which was Hadrian's Villa (and eventually Villa d'Este).

* Hadrian's Villa was *really* neat, but I highly recommend booking a tour guide which we did not do. I feel like we would've gotten much more out of the experience with a guide. Instead, we were at the mercy of little placards at each numbered station along the tour route which had a brief description of what we were looking at in both Italian and English. So, we got the basic stuff but, again, probably would have had a much richer experience with someone more knowledgeable with us.

* After Hadrian's Villa, we walked about 5 minutes up the hill to a little spot on the corner called Pizzeria La Pergola which sold pizza by the slice. We bought 8 squares of pizza and a few sodas for 13€! Nothing fancy but it totally hit the spot.

* After lunch, we took another bus back into central Tivoli which was just a short 10-minute walk away from Villa d'Este, our next stop. Unlike Hadrian's Villa which was entirely outdoors, Villa d'Este is half an indoor museum and half outdoor garden. If you're into art, you can easily spend an hour or two here, but we sort of breezed through before strolling through the gardens where we spent most of our time.

* After Villa d'Este, we walked into another tobacco shop (lol) and bought bus tickets back into Rome (the Cotral bus). If you're curious, it takes you as far as Ponte Mammolo which is like the eastern-most transit station of Rome, and from there, we took the Metro back to where we were staying.

* Tivoli is a very popular day trip destination from Rome since it's a very quick 30-minute train ride. From start to finish, we were there from about 9am to 3pm and felt that was a full, satisfying day though we definitely could have spent a few more hours exploring downtown Tivoli. There seemed to be a lot of really cool shops and restaurants that we didn't get to check out. All in all, we really liked it and would recommend it, especially if you're into Italian art and history.

**Orvieto**

* Oh baby, let me tell you about Orvieto. Before I got to Italy, when I pictured in my mind a sleepy, rural Italian town with narrow, cobblestone alleyways and side streets...little did I know, I was picturing Orvieto. **What a *beautiful*, romantic, little city.**

* Despite being a little farther away - a 1.5 hour train ride - like Tivoli, Orvieto is totally doable in one full day. From the Orvieto train station, you have to take this little tram (""un funicolare"") uphill to basically the entrance of Orvieto. I think you can also just technically walk there, but it's 15 minutes, all uphill.

* Immediately upon exiting the funicular station, to the right is the Pozzo di San Patrizio, or St. Patrick's Well, which, as I understand it, was built a very long time ago to protect town denizens in the event of a siege. After buying a ticket, you can enter from the top of the well and walk all 248 steps down to the bottom before, spoilers, walking 248 steps back up to the top. We got some pretty cool photos in there, for sure.

* After St. Patrick's Well, we made our way into Orvieto proper. We got some take-away cappuccinos in a little cafe at the bottom of the hill before heading in. Everyone basically starts at the same entrance, and it's a long walk upward into town with countless shops and restaurants on either side.

* I was told that the Orvieto staples which you should absolutely try are wild boar (cinghiale) and pigeon (piccione) which I was totally down for. Unfortunately, the restaurant we went to, Osteria di Mamma Angela, did not have either. :( However, the meal we *did* have there was amazing - highly recommended. (Also, I *did* have cinghiale at a later location which I'll talk about when we get there...)

* As you make your way uphill (I keep saying 'hill' this and 'hill' that, but it's really not that steep, I promise) you'll start to see a giant clock tower looming in the distance but inching closer and closer. This is Torre del Moro and - guess what! - you get to go inside and walk to the top! We did just that, and the views were incredible.

* Also in Orvieto is the Duomo di Orvieto which was quite possibly the most beautiful church we saw in all of Italy. Truly breathtaking. It does cost 2€ per person to go inside, though.

* The **cool thing about Orvieto is that it's an entirely walkable city**. I would guess you can briskly walk from one end to the other in 30 minutes, no problem. But the fun part is going down all the beautiful, picturesque side streets and seeing what's around every corner. Loved it here and would recommend it to literally anyone.

**Naples / Napoli**

* I've got Naples, Greg. Can you milk me?

* I honestly had no idea what I was getting into with Naples at first. I just knew it was a very popular destination in Italy. As I did more research, however, I learned that it's quite **a polarizing place that people either seem to love or hate**. Well, mark me down as a Naples lover, baby.

* As soon as we left the train station, Napoli Centrale, and started making our way towards Via S. Gregorio Armeno, we walked past a group of 3-4 old men huddled around a high table playing some sort of game with three overturned cups. I must have looked like the dumb tourist that I am, because the main guy running the game was pointing at me, smiling, and gesturing for me to come over. I learned later from an Italian friend that this was a very popular scam lol so it's a good thing that I didn't actually walk over.

* We actually followed [this great blog post](https://anthonyinitaly.com/one-day-in-naples-the-perfect-itinerary/) which I'd recommend to anyone who only has one day in Naples. We veered off when we saw something interesting, of course, but otherwise followed it basically to a tee, and it worked out pretty great.

* The best way I can describe Naples is - it's all of the great, good, and 'rough' parts of Manhattan, filtered through an Italian lens. It's lively and bustling. In some areas, it's grimy and dingy; there was one particular alley we walked down that was filled with human feces which didn't really bother me that much but really freaked out my wife lol. (Edit: OK, maybe ""filled"" is an exaggeration, but there were definitely at least three large piles of poop.) Needless to say, **if you love getting lost in a place like Chinatown, New York, you'll probably love Naples**.

* We got lunch at **Gino e Toto Sorbillo** - one of the top spots in Naples for classic Neapolitan-style pizza. We had just arrived as they were opening for lunch and were discouraged to see a *huge* line out front. Fortunately, it's a very big spot and, even with about ~30 people ahead of us, we were seated immediately. They *may* have an English menu? But the ones provided to us were in full Italian, so we really struggled to figure out what was what. I just ordered a random one on the menu which turned out to be anchovies, capers, and olives - yum! Crust was suuuper light and fluffy.

* (Like NYC...) **There are so many other parts of Naples, too, that offer a wildly different change of pace and vibes.** We ended our day (as detailed in the blog post) by walking along the water before stopping at a little bar for a round of spritzes while enjoy the beautiful view of Mount Vesuvius in the distance. I would have loved to spend the night and hang out another day, but my wife is firmly in the Naples hater category. Womp womp.

**Florence**

* OK so we cheated a little and actually stayed in Florence overnight, so we technically had two full days. But I'm so glad that we did. Florence was really incredible. Just the **architecture of all the buildings as you walked around the city was really impressive and awe-inspiring**, nothing like anywhere else we visited in Italy. It was very clean, too! This was my wife's favorite place in Italy besides Rome, and probably mine too.

* **This place is extremely dangerous for your wallet**. From the train station, it took us forever to get anywhere, because my wife kept stopping into random jewelry and clothing stores. It's very easy to spend money in this city.

* We kind of just winged the first day, for the most part. We walked around and saw a few of the major sites (most of which are...hard to miss): **Basilica di Santa Maria Novella, Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, and Piazza della Signoria**. We didn't get tickets or go inside any of the churches; we were pretty churched out by this point of the trip. We did consider going into the Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze, home of the famous Statue of David, but the line for this was so insanely long that we didn't even bother.

* When in Florence, you have to Florentine Steak, right? We got lunch reservations at this small place called **Antico Ristoro di Cambi**. We sat right in front of a meat display case that showcased huge, thick cuts of raw beef and large bowls of antipasti items (olives, pickled vegetables, etc.). Maybe I'm wrong about this but it at least *looked* like a place where actual local families would hunker down for lunch. I ordered a tagliatelle cinghiale (wild boar) while my wife ordered a carbonara and we both split a Florentine steak. I ordered the steak medium rare which is my personal preference back home. In spite of this, the steak came out...pretty rare lol. But I didn't make a big fuss about it or anything. I understand that's typically how it's served here, so I just rolled with it. Let me tell you guys - **this was easily the best meal I had the entire trip.** So, so, so good. Edit: Oh my God, how could I forget? If you go here, you MUST order the steak with a side of onions. They're low-and-slow cooked in the oven so they're suuuuuper tender and naturally very sweet, topped off with a little Parmesan cheese. It was the *perfect* accompaniment to the steak.

* Edit: Florence is also famous for their handmade leather goods! There are countless leather shops and vendors everywhere in the city. However, we made a brief stop into the Scuola di Cuoio, or, the School of Leather which is a really cool half museum, half store that sells belts, handbags, wallets, etc. all made on site by students at the school. I treated myself to a buttery smooth men's wallet with a pebbled texture. If you go here, bring cash!! You get a pretty nice discount if you pay in cash as opposed to card. You also get a free engraving for any purchase over 50€. I got my initials stamped in gold on the inside of my new wallet.

* Later that night, we did a pasta and tiramisu cooking class through GetYourGuide which was so much fun. Our facilitator was a young woman named Julia, and she was super sweet and funny. There were two other couples in the class. All of this was in a large back room of a restaurant. After we made everything, the kitchen staff of the restaurant would cook our pasta for us and we all sat down at a table and ate together. Unlimited wine too. Price came out to be around $80 per person which, in my opinion, was well worth it.

* Next day was Uffizi Gallery, Boboli Gardens, and Piazza Pitti. We bought two 3-day passes which covered all three places for a discounted price online. To be very honest, we were pretty exhausted by this point in the trip *and* it was a very rainy day. So, this entire day was kind of a shit show lol. After slogging it through all three spots - it's about a 10-minute walk from Uffizi to the other two locations which are in the same area - we just bounced around to a cafe or two to wait out the rain until we had to catch our train back to Rome. 

* Edit: My wife reminded me that we had a great lunch on this day, too. We had asked our pasta making class facilitator, Julia, a Florentine local, about what to eat if we wanted a real taste of local food. She suggested Ribollita (a very hearty stew with beans, zucchini, swiss chard), Lampredotto (tripe), and Peposo (beef stew). We took her advice and ordered all three at a local indoor marketplace. Everything was pretty tasty, but that Peposo slapped hard. Perfect comfort food-type lunch for a rainy day.


I realize this is already quite long, so I'll end it here. Let me know if you guys have any questions, will respond when I can.

ItalyTravel,"This sub was such a huge help in offering suggestions before we left on our trip, I thought I’d give a recap of everything! Sorry it’s so long.  As the title says, we really didn’t have a specific itinerary except for hotels booked - we just wanted to walk the streets, eat good food, and see pretty places. I know that style isn’t for everyone, but it worked for us ☺️ it’s a beautiful place with great people, and I hope to return someday! 

Here’s our 10 day recap Firenze —> Roma —> Positano —> Napoli

Florence: 2 nights

We took the train from the airport to Roma Termini station. We used the trenitalia app to book tickets to Florence, and it worked really well. We did book these the day before since we had no idea if they sell out, but we ended up getting to Rome earlier than anticipated, so we moved the tickets up an hour. The station was a great place to grab a sandwich and pastry and eat on the train. 

We did a ton of walking and going into little shops. The only museum we did was Uffizi, and we were able to just walk up and buy tickets midday. As an added bonus, there was a nice view of the Duomo at the end. 

A lot of the areas we walked around in felt very catered to tourists -a gelato shop and leather store every block - but we didn’t mind. We did have a few people try the bracelet scam on us, but they were pleasant when we said no thank you. We had dinner on the rooftop terrace of our hotel, which was a great nighttime view of everything. 

For food, we just walked around and looked up restaurants that we passed. I usually use Yelp at home, but using Google was much more common here. We didn’t have a bad meal and ate tons of gelato! Def could’ve spent more time here. 

Rome: 3 nights 

We took the train back to Roma Termini station and walked to our hotel. 

We did have the colloseum tickets booked in advance, per the advice on this sub.  We luckily got them directly through the official website, and my husband was able to snag tickets that included the Attic - another great suggestion from here. I cannot explain how incredible it was! We took an elevator up and were able to go to the highest spot, and there were maybe 10-15 people max around us the entire time. We were able to spend as much time as we wanted up there with no crowd and just take it all in, as well as a gorgeous view of the forum and the city. Highly recommend if you are able to!

We also booked a cooking class through Viator, and it was so fun! We made Fettuccine, Ravioli, and Tiramisu with a small group of 9. The instructor was great and made sure we all did it ourselves, but also helped us to make sure it turned out well. 

Other than that, we just walked around the city, saw things like the Trevi fountain, Spanish steps, and pantheon (tickets were no problem to get right there. If you paid with cash, you also got to skip the long line at the kiosk). We stopped in a few churches along the way and ate amazing food again. 

Positano: 3 nights
We took the train from Roma Termini to Salerno. We splurged on business class (mostly because that’s just what was available and it was only like 30 euro more), and it was so nice! A small, separate private room with two other seats, and they came to bring us water and snacks. 

From Salerno, we took a ferry that we bought tickets for from travelmar‘s website. We booked this on the train ride over with no problem. Ferry left on time, had plenty of room, and we had no motion sickness issues. It stopped at Amalfi on the way, and it took around an hour total. 

We stayed at Villa Rosa, which I cannot recommend enough! The rooms were beautiful; there were of course quite a few stairs to get up, but not nearly as many as some places. We were able to carry our carry-on sized bags with no issue (just got a little sweaty). My husband and I aren’t big seafood people, so we didn’t hit up some of the fancier restaurants because of this, but we ate so well! Amazing lemon pastas and desserts. Again, we just looked up restaurants when we got there. 

We did book a sunset cruise via Viator, and it was a great experience. There were like a dozen people on board, we got Prosecco, and the driver and other worker were super friendly and fun. We got some of the best pictures from the trip here! 

Positano was the favorite for both of us. It was a little touristy, but it really emptied at night and the streets are all so beautiful. 


Naples: 1 night

We decided to take the ferry back to Salerno, then the train to Naples. We could have taken a ferry right to Naples, but we opted for the shorter ferry ride instead. Plus we had no issues with using the trenitalia app and enjoyed the train experience just fine. Spent the last night walking around and getting pizza at Sorbillo - so good. I will say that Naples was my least favorite spot of the trip, but I admit that I didn’t really get a chance to explore it, so I’m sure it is amazing as well! 

Just made this to say that you can have a great time without having everything planned out!

ItalyTravel,"**VENICE**

**Day 1:** We arrived in Venice in the evening after a long flight... Took the boat taxi into Venice (took a while because the Orange line comes every 45 minutes). Checked into our hotel and explored the islands a bit -- managed to go to Vino Vero for cicchetti and wine until we decided it was time to hit the hay.

**Day 2:** Woke up early to go out for a walk around Venice (the fog made everything look so...ethereal) and to avoid the day-trippers. Started off at the Rialto, then visited the Mocenigo Palace Museum. We originally thought we had too long of a list on our 'first real day' in the city, but managed to get through everything before 1PM since most of them were checking out the facades of old churches and visiting bridges (like Ponte delle Tette). We found L' Bacaro de' Bischeri to have incredibly delicious sandwiches! Had a few drinks at Hotel Danielli, then we headed back to the hotel to rest. We were originally going to get dinner at Antico Dolo, but went to Dal Moro's instead (not bad)!

**Day 3:** We visited St. Mark's Square early in the morning and took photos of the empty square (except it was full of construction barriers!). We also visited Cafe Florian to take some photos of the interior and also for the...expensive espressos. We tried to get into the garden, but it was closed! So we instead did some shopping until our timed entry at Ca'Rezzonico. We got some gelato at Grom and headed back to our hotel for a quick rest and to drop off our bags until our next timed entry, which was at Peggy Guggenheim. From there, we visited Palazzo Grassi (it was a spur of the moment decision)! We had dinner at Trattoria Anzolo Raffaele. Absolutely wonderful dining experience.

**Day 4:** We took a morning tour of Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica, which ate up a good portion of our time (it was a great tour!) and for lunch, we went to L' Bacaro de' Bischeri again. We also decided to get an aperol spritz at Trattoria San Polo in Campo San Polo. We visited Carlo Goldini's House and Gallerie dell'Accademia, which housed some fantastic paintings. Finally, for our last day in Venice, we went up to the rooftop of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi for a phenomenal view of the city and its canals. Dinner was at L'Anice Stellato.

**BOLOGNA**

**Day 5:** We arrived a little past noon in this beautifully red city. Literally the first thing we did after getting the keys to our AirBnb was walk right over to Mo Mortadella lab... This is where I discovered (re-discovered?) my love for cured meats. From there, we walked to the university, and doubled back for a disappointing gelato that I don't remember the name of. We went to Mercato delle Erbe to pick up cheese, a stick of salami, tomatoes, artichoke, and basil.

**Day 6:** We didn't structure Bologna as strictly as we did for Venice (no timed entry tickets were purchased), so we had the leisure of doing whatever we wanted on the itinerary we built. We first checked out the Tourist Office where we purchased tickets to climb the clocktower at Palazzo d'Accursio (this was really cool) and we got a very beautiful view of Piazza Maggiore, San Petronio, and the land surrounding the city. You also got a view of the 666 porticos leading up to Santuario Madonna di San Luca (which we eventually walked up the next day). We filled our time with museums (Archaeological Museum of Bologna and Teatro Anatomico), ate at Tigellino, grabbed a gelato at Cremeria Cavour, and sat at a bar in front of a piazza and sipped on aperol spritzes until it was time for dinner at Trattoria da me. (I especially enjoyed the crescentine plate. I could've had just that for my entree.)

**Day 7:** Again, we didn't have anything planned, so we took this day in stride, visiting vintage shops, grabbing fresh pasta at Le Sfogline, making sure to hit up Pasta Fresca Naldi (we were number two in line) for lasagna, tortellini, etc. Then to burn off our lunch, we hit the road to walk up to San Luca, but not before stopping at the storied 	Stadio Renato Dall'Ara to pay tribute to Bologna FC! (It was on the way, so we figured why not!). The walk up the hill to San Luca took longer than expected. It's straight up a hill and my god, what a workout for your glutes. I would not recommend walking up when it hits 80F+ -- we were sweating even at 70F and we consider ourselves relatively fit! The views are worth it though, and you can go up to the top of the basilica (if you pay, of course). We finished the day off with cooking our pastas and enjoying the veggies we had bought earlier, and walked to the most delicious gelato of the trip at Cremeria Santo Stefano.

**FLORENCE**

**Day 8:** Okay, so I have a confession to make. Florence was an after-thought in this itinerary. We were originally going to make Florence a day trip from Bologna, but changed to a single night in this wonderfully beautiful city, which ended up being a mistake, because after having spent one night there, I wanted to stay even longer. We stayed not too far from the train station (this is how we got around from city to city) -- and our lunch was at I Re d'Egitto -- a small kebab shop that was pretty dang good. We hit up all of the necessary spots like the Duomo, the Basilica Santa Maria Novella, and Ponte Vecchio. I did manage to get tickets to get to Boboli Gardens, so we spent a fair amount of time exploring it! Pitti Palace looked amazing -- it was a bummer not to have gone in. Our dinner was at Acqua Al 2 -- interestingly enough, all of the patrons spoke American English. No Italian was heard. We had the steak (balsamic vinegar sauce and the blackberry sauce) and I was honestly super surprised -- they were delicious!

**ROME**

**Day 9:** We had a few hours to kill until we departed for Rome, so we managed to get tickets to Torre di Arnolfo the night before and climbed it for a breathtaking view of the city. Man, Florence is just beautiful. We left Florence and ended up in Rome a few hours later. Our Airbnb was in Monti and the neighborhood reminded me a lot of Paris mixed with Mexico City and a little bit of New York thrown in for good measure. The first thing we did in Rome was go to the closest supermarket to buy wine and snacks. Then we did a bit of exploring the neighborhood to get our bearings. For lunch, we found a sandwich shop called Fuorinorma and got the porchetta sandwich that I gave 5 stars.  Walked to the Roman Forum, where all I did was say ""Holy shit, holy shit"" and the like because honestly, I could not imagine the grandeur of Roman buildings until I saw it in person. Dinner was a sandwich from All'antico Vinaio which turned out to be an incredible letdown due to the bread being hard and having to substitute pancetta for proscuitto that had some hard bits in it! We ate the sandwiches in front of the Pantheon, which made for an incredible view.

**Day 10:** We had a walking tour (same company that operated the tour in Venice) of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum. I really suggest taking a tour of the forum because: 1. the tour guides explain the importance of the temples and buildings that once stood; 2. they take you through in a chronological manner; 3. the tours are structured in a way that lets you absorb the information without getting too down-in-the-details (unless you start asking super specific questions). The colosseum, as you could imagine was shoulder-to-shoulder crowded, but thanks to the tour, we skipped all that, and entered rather quickly. (They did have to check passports/ID upon entry to both the Forum and colosseum, just FYI!) After the tour, we walked over to the Circus Maximus, walked along the length of it, headed into the city center, where we quickly learned that moving around Trevi Fountain will add 10+ minutes to your walk. We visited Piazza Navona, then walked back down to the Vittorio Emanuele Monument. For dinner, we ended up at Piatto Romano. The greens were delicious and so was the pasta. I got the spaghettoni amatriciana. Fantastic.

**Day 11:** The only pressing thing we had to do this day was a timed entry to the Pantheon. We just did some sightseeing -- Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore, walking up the Spanish Steps, heading to Piazza del Popolo, getting lunch at some mediocre restaurant only because we didn't have coins for the bathroom...! Anyway, I think we logged about 14 miles this day walking from one end of the city to the other. The Pantheon was really cool -- insane how they constructed this giant dome (they apparently had filled it with sand before putting concrete over it). For dinner, we managed to get into Trattoria da Mario. The camerierie was super attentive and cordial -- I think he appreciated that we tried to order and ask questions in Italian.

**Day 12:** This was our museum day -- we hit up the Museum and Crypt of the Capuchin Friars, Villa Medici, and Galleria Borghese in a span of six hours. We did it! And survived. I think relaxing in the park and going out on a rowboat also helped us relax (although I did the rowing). We went back to Fuorinorma for a cold cut platter and another round of porchetta sandwiches.

**Day 13:** We went to Hadrian's Villa via metro. We got lost (took Metro B towards Jonio, when we needed to take the B line to Rebibbia). We got off at one of the stops and walked towards the Bologna metro stop (took about an hour!) because the train did not come (we had been waiting for 30 min...) and fortunately for us, the Rebibbia train came within moments of us entering the Bologna station. Anyway, Hadrian's Villa is...how can I put this into words? Fricking HUGE. It will...leave you speechless. I was walking around open mouthed. The size of the compounds is...well, huge. When we got back into the city, we took a cab to Trastevere to get to Janiculum Hill, and got some suppli from Suppli and some pizza. The suppli was delicious. We also got some gelato and a cannoli from Fior di Luna and that was spectacular. But in retrospect, I'm glad we didn't spend too much time in Trastevere -- we didn't care for the youthful vibe. (Our friends from Rome also said the food quality there is not too good and mostly for tourists, but that's just an opinion from them!)

**Day 14:** We visited Palazzo Colonna and my goodness it was an absolutely beautiful palazzo (still owned by the same family) and we were greeted by the Count himself! Very, very cool. Then we made our way to the Baths of Caracalla -- for some weird reason, I enjoyed this more than I expected. We originally planned to check out Appian Way, but by this time, we were exhausted and I think we made the right decision. We had dinner in Pigneto at an osteria, but not before we filled our stomach with cold cuts and aperol spritzes around the same location!

**Day 15:** Flew out of FCO!

Things I learned:

1. Rest time is *crucial* to enjoy yourself. You're walking 10+ miles a day (which includes shuffling around museums) and you will get tired. (This will also save you from complaining and annoying your travel partner(s)!)
2. Gelato is a MUST during hot days. And the sugar will give you a little pick-me-up.
3. Cafe espresso will also help with pick-me-ups.
4. Have one euro coins for public bathrooms! You will need it to use them.
5. Book your museum tickets in advance!
6. For larger and popular neighborhoods / cities, absolutely book a reservation for dinner.
7. Have a rough idea of what and where you'd like to go. And try to view attractions within the vicinity! (This applies to any trip you take.)
8. Wear comfortable shoes -- I brought hiking boots that look like sneakers and they were extremely helpful with ankle support and comfort for all of our long walking days.
9. Bring sunscreen!
10. Brush up on some Italian phrases :)
11. Enjoy your limited time!",t2_lpa51,"Post-trip report: Two weeks in Italy (Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome)",0.97,69,1714413827.0,1714413827.0,45,_PM_ME_YOUR_SSN_,1cg5u9q
ItalyTravel,"Hi all! A while ago I posted about my 1 week trip anticipation so here is my updated experience!

So my Trip: I'm a college senior (22F) and went for my spring break study abroad trip.  I went to Florence, Bologna, and Milan! My first flight there was delayed and then the connecting flight in paris boarded early (???) I had to run to my gate day 1. My flight home was not good at all (thanks Air France :/). 

**March 2: Florence**

Florence was probably my favorite! We went on a walking tour followed by a cooking class where I got to make ravvoli and a pesto type of dish. We also got to put together our own tiramisu. I walked to Ponte Vecchio in my free time. 

**March 3:**

\-  we went to the Uffizi Gallery (loved), the Academia to see The David (bigger statue than I thought) 

\-  did some bargaining at the San Lorenzo leather market. Got a brown purse down from 110 to 40 euros then exchanged it for a nicer red purse for 10 euros more (so 50 euros in total) 

\- Visited the Santa Croce Basilica 

**March 4th:** 

\- Visited Palazzo Vecchio 

\- Had a leather workshop where we learned about different types of leather and made our own wallets (I chose colors that matched my red purse)

\- Went to a vineyard for lunch and wine tasting 

**March 5th: Bologna**

\- Visited the Barilla manufacturing plant and got to see how the pasta gets made. We got a huge goody bag of pasta, snacks, and pesto which I will be pleased to eat. 

\- Went to Parmigiano-Reggiano factory and saw how cheese was made. Got to see the cheese master (lol) and tried some aged cheeses from 12-36 months. I got my dad some cheese from there since he's a cheese fan.  

**March 6: Bologna**

\- Had a food tour of Bologna! Got to try different pastas and meats (yum)

\- visted the university of Bologna

* This night me and my classmates went to a nightclub that was with other college students! I probably stayed out till 2am and they had early 2000s american music, reggaeton, and italian music. This was interesting because I think every girl in our class was hit on by an italian student at one point. I had a fun conversation with a guy my age from venice.

**March 7th: Traveling to Milan** 

\- Visted Ducati Manfucaturing plant/museum. This was very cool! I was not aware of the brand before but we saw how bikes were put together, and saw the history of ducati. I also got to sit on the bikes in the front of the museum. 

\- SAW THE DUOMO. This was absolutely BREATHTAKING. We got a tour of the inside and went to the top while the sun was going down. It was very magical. I sorta just looked outside to the street for a while and this is definitely a memory worth remembering. There was music also playing so it was great.

March 8 (My birthday): Milan

\- Went on a fashion tour! We went to a famous designer! she showed us how she crafts her designs what she makes for top brands. We got to try on her coats she makes (mine was pink). We then went on a walk to the luxury brand stores and was explained to about the clothing in windows and cool things about fashion! The Galleria Vittorio Emanuelle was cool. I just walked through it and was able to spin my heel on the bull. Did not even attempt to shop there lol.

end of trip.

\-----------------------

My Cultural Experience: I'm African American and saw the many tiktoks about people who did not have a good time presumed by racism. I am not taking away from those people's experieces, However I did not have that experience at all. The parts I visited were more diverse than I expected. There were Black Italians in literally every place I went, some were  working in the stores, some also either living there or passing through. 

In France, people assumed I spoke french. In italy, people assumed I spoke Italian. My stereotypical 'American' classmates were automatically spoken to in English. They were blondes so when I was with them they got lots of stares. When I was out with just my two other hispanic classmates, we blended in and no one bothered us. At the leather market I bought my mom a necklace and had my first italian conversation. The man called me pretty and after a while he figured out I didn't actually speak Italian. After asking where I was from then he switched over to english.

 In Bologna I was asked for direction from a man from Torino looking for the towers. At one store a lady assumed I worked there and was speaking to me in italian but I won't assume this was race related. I was greeted in every store I went to.

&#x200B;

\--------------------

Flight home:

This part SUCKED. My flight from Milan to Paris was delayed by 2 hours causing me due to a weight imbalance on the incoming flight.  My two classmates and I missed our connection in Paris.My classmates were booked on a flight to Detroit so were able to run and make that one My flight was automatically rebooked for the next day so I had to spend the night by myself in a hotel in Paris. Air France was not helpful and it took me two hours to figure out how to get my hotel voucher. The next day the gate agent had the audacity to ask me if I wanted to take an even later flight because the flight they rebooked me for was oversold. um hell no. He had to call a supervisor over to override it. My layover in Atlanta was 8.5 hours. I got my global entry interview after an hour of waiting so that's good.

ItalyTravel,"Hey all!

I used this sub a lot to plan our trip to Italy, so I wanted to report back. Thank you all for your insight, even if I was just lurking on posts.

Our trip: 14 days, flying into Milan and out of Rome. Trip as a couple, and we spent 3-4 nights at each of four hubs: Parma, Lucca, Orvieto, and Rome. We stayed at AirBnBs for all four spots.

Parma: LOVED. We did factory tours at 4 Madonne (parmigiano reggiano), Conti Proscuitti (prosciutto di Parma), and Acetaia Giusti (balsamic). Would absolutely recommend all three, but you might be able to find a more personal cheese tour elsewhere (4 Madonne produces 2% of all parmigiano reggiano, so it’s a big set up and a little impersonal/sterile). Our favorite meals were at Trattoria Da Me (Bologna) and Pizzeria da Gaetano di Marigliano Gaetano (Montecchio Emilia).

Lucca: an incredibly cute town. We rolled in right as the gigantic comics and games convention was ending, so some restaurants were on holiday, but we still found plenty of things open. Our highlights: walking in the wall, wine tasting at Colle di Bordocheo, and the food! Enoteca Vanni and Gigi Trattoria were our faves. We did do a day trip to Cinque Terre during this part of the stay, which we didn’t love. CT was just too touristy for us, and the hikes we wanted to do were closed.

On the ride from Lucca to Orvieto, we stopped in Montalcino for lunch at Boccon Di Vino and wine tasting at Poggio Antico. Highly recommend the lunch spot - when they say “panoramic terrace”, they mean it - and the Michelin star was well earned. Next trip, I’d happily stay in Siena and bum around wineries for a few days. Wine heaven.

Orvieto: amazing, so unique. We loved the underground tour, St. Patrick’s Well, and the Basilica. Favorite eats: Trattoria La Palomba (Michelin star well earned), and Mezza Luna (not fancy, but authentic and amazing). Skip I Sette Consoli and Le Grotte Del Funaro - the reviews are better than the food. 

On the ride from Orvieto to Rome, we did a truffle hunting experience from AirBnB, which was super cool. We hiked through the woods and saw the dogs hunt. Very fun and unique. Then the owners made us truffle - filled lunch!

Rome: we’re glad we went, but three nights were enough for us. The Colosseum Underground tour was amazing, the Vatican was cool to see, and we enjoyed the Capitoline Museum. After spending so much time in the countryside though, the city just didn’t hit for us. 

What we learned: just because somewhere says it takes American Express doesn’t mean it actually does. Or that it takes card at all. Many places hadn’t updated their Google listing in forever, so hours or locations were frequently wrong. And Google Translate is your best friend. So many people were kind and gracious, we long as we made an effort to speak in their language. Also, eat the local food! We ate pigeon, vegetable soup, egg-less pasta noodles, and so many other specialties we wouldn’t normally have gravitated toward because they were local, and we’re glad we did.

ItalyTravel,"Arrived on train from Bologna. Hacked our way through literally the whole planet of people that decided to visit Florence the exact time as us. Walked past Duomo, pitstop for a cheeky wine gloryhole, and continued across the City to cross bridge and get to our apartment.

Can't recommend enough this City. Absolutely loved it, and it's super fun also to just hire a Vespa (150cc you need a bike license, 125cc you're good with car license), and just hit the road and pootle around the Tuscan countryside. In fact, the first town we got to, there was a wee fare going on, with food stalls. I had literally the best fish and chips I've ever had in my life, from a rando mobile fish and chip can, and beside it - absolutely the most amazing god-tier [beer](https://www.facebook.com/birrificiolilium) I have EVER drank in my life. Not even joking, it was sososo good. Zero marketing. Zero sales outside of the local area. Blokes' name was Leonardo, and spoke English enough to tell me this. 

The Floretine steak Im not going to lie - I'm a culinary heathen and prefer my steaks medium-well. Soz. But, you know, when in ~~Rome~~ Florence and all.. Turns out the steak is, indeed, everything. And they served it on a sizzling hot plate, so having it sliced means you can have it cook through just that bit more - but to be honest, it didn't need it. It was perfect on its own.

The gelato I didn't really find anything to lock me in the balls more than Suzo in Venice. I'm here for a few hours more in case someone can suggest a kick-in-the-boll*cks good gelato place.

Coffee? Eh. This wasn't a focus for me in this City like it was in Bologna, but it wasn't as bitter and Robusta-ised as elsewhere I thought. Win.

5.30am was when we got our pics of all the major epic attractions line the Duomo and the sun rising gave super nice photos of the bridge.

Sundown - yeah, I'm from Phuket so I'm not going to sit for 90 mins waiting for it to set with a billion other people. The sunrise was spesh enough with zero people too.

Renting an e-scooter was a mission - there's one that is super-mid that wants to sms you a code. D*ckheads. Lots of tourists in a city aren't going to be able to receive a sms especially if they're using an esim for data only. TL;DR - Use Bird scooters. But also beware the cobbled uneven roads on an e-scooter will break your brainstem off of your head. Still fun though whizzing around the city at dawn.

Heaps loads more I want to write, but this is my experience of Florence and it was the absolute t*ts of a place. Heading to Pisa after grabbing a car, and then 12 days of zero planned fun agenda. Anyone got suggestions for southern end of Italy, I'm all ears.

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone,

I have a question that's been bugging me for a while. During my recent trips to Italy, I noticed that many public places such as restaurants, bars, tourist attractions, and gas stations often have toilets without seats. I've encountered this in Bari, Sicily, and Milan. It's quite puzzling because in hotels and apartments, the toilets do have seats, but in public places, they are frequently missing.

Why is this the case? I'm genuinely curious and not trying to criticize. Thanks in advance for any insights!

I spent a week in Emilia Romagna, visiting Bologna, Ravenna and San Marino too. 

I visited alone from Scotland. I want to say thank you because every single person was so kind to me and so helpful. There were times where I’d be standing on the bus just looking lost and somebody would come and help me. This helped me so much and made me feel so welcomed.

I am also a young black woman and I heard stories of racism on this sub which had me a wee bit apprehensive. Whilst I don’t ignore the experiences of others, that personally was not my experience.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all -Just recently completed a 11 day a trip to Italy.   I really liked our itinerary and while it may not be for everyone here is what we did.  (thanks for many of the ideas from everyone here !).

Flight -- CLT-JFK-FCO.    Stop 1 **ROME**:   Took the late flight (10:15pm) which I liked because we go there around noon and didnt have to worry about waiting around to check into our place.   Our first stop was Rome (3 nights) and stayed in Spanish Steps just north of the Steps and its def much more quiet the farther north you go from the steps.   We had a VRBO that was  nice with a top floor patio which had some pretty incredible views.   Would recommend if anyone needs it!  Although I researched so many interesting restaurants the reality of the situation is we stayed in close walking distance to our VRBO and ate nearby.  In hindsight I would say is the amount of time I put into restaurant searching was probably unneeded (unless you have just that one place you have to go to). We ate def more casual and didnt indulge into anything really fancy and felt like all of our meals were great (family for 4 with teenagers so casual was more our style) .    We did two official tours:  Colosseum/Forum (private) and Vatican (small group).  Loved the Colosseum/Forum tour and while I loved the Vatican tour it was a long one and hot!   With only 3 nights you have to get over the fact that Rome is such an interesting, diverse and big city that you are only going to scratch the surface to what you can see - if I had more time I would have no issues staying 5 night or more just in Rome.  Loved it.

Stop 2:  **Massa Lubrense** (also 3 nights) via a train from Rome to Naples and then a car.  Massa Lubrense is a very cool city right outside of Sorrento.  I felt like this was the most authentic part of the trip.   We stayed  across the water from Capri with some great views from our patio.  Again this VRBO was also very good (I usually only do 5 star VRBO with a long history of reviews). DM if you want the place.   We did two tours here - Pompeii and a boat tour of Capri.  One tactical error:   the drive from Massa Lubresense to Pompeii is no joke esp with summer traffic- in hindsight I would have done this tour on the way from Naples to Massa Lubresnse instead of circling back the next day.   I really liked Pompeii.  It was a hot day but not brutal so the 2 hours tour was spot on -- private tour again and I would recommend that for Pompeii.  The next day we did a private boat tour -- almost 8 hours of Capri.  Wow!  This was the highlight no doubt!    It was a beautiful day -- maybe a tad hazy from the African sands - but when you get up close to Capri and the caves the haze dissipates.   We stoped to swim maybe 3-4 times and Capitan was top notch feeding me Peronis' most of the trip!  I dont think you can do this trip to the coast without some type of boat tour.     The only negative of Massa Lubrense and probably the entire peninsula  -- mosquitoes are bad- - I live in Charlotte and I thought we had bad mosquitoes.  Bring your spray, lotion of preference -- once we bought that it got better but we have 2 out of 4 in the family that are magnets!. Massa Lubrense is not easy to get around  due to how remote it is  (i.e. limited taxis) but the nice thing is most of the local restaurants would pick u up for free.    I thought the food we had here was the most amazing of the whole trip - the fresh fish, the fresh squid/octupus.  Wow!   I dont think I had any pasta for 3 days- and had an amazing Neopolatian pizza closer to Naples -- other than that it was seafood, and fresh vegetables (zucchini was our goto).  The big miss here?  Well we prioritized Capri over the Amalfi coast so missed that this trip - again I would stay 5 nights here without a doubt!

Stop 3:  **Florenc**e (also 3 nights) via car to Naples and then Train to Florence.   I really loved Florence -- we got off the train and then our VRBO host met us at the train station and with a 7 min walk we were at our place.   This VRBO as probably my favorite!  We planned nothing in Florence and instead spent most our short stay walking about and taking in the sites.  I think we were a bit over-toured as this stage and enjoyed have nothing to do. The last day we did do a winery trip up to San Gimignano.  This was also great- the winemaker's mom made us a 3 course lunch and we sampled ALOT of wine.   We did a quick tour of San Gimignano but this day trip was about wine!  We then did a stop in the Chianti region for more sampling

A few things I would say from what I learned as a ""first timer"" in Italy:

1. Its hot in June/July and while all our cars and houses had AC it wasn't up to the American standards and we always felt a bit sweaty.
2. We did use the trains alot and if I had to do it over again I may use Trenitalia over Italo (we used biz class only).  Italo had terrible wifi and the train rides can be long  I found Trenitalia to be a bit more spacious too.   For a first timer in an European train station  it can be a bit confusing but once you get through one, they are all pretty much the same (Rome is def a bit overwhelming)  If you can, chill a bottle of Prosecco and bring it one board!
3. Dont stress too much about luggage.  I know alot of people are going to tell you to pack light and while I  cant disagree with that, if you bring one or two big rollers-- dont stress!   The trains are super accommodating for luggage and never felt stressed about room (again we were in biz class).  The most amazing thing to me was how easy Florence was to roll your luggage right down the street from the train station.  For 4 people, 3 had roller carryons with one small backpack each, and one had one large checked roller.   (the only thing I would say here is make sure your rollers are working well - we did upgrade some really old luggage before this trip and I will say 100% worth it to have  easy rolling luggage)
4. if you are doing 10-14 days (maybe even a year!)  you have to just let it go that you are not going to see/do everything.   While I dont think we were over scheduled, I felt a few times where we were approaching that (hence our ""off day"" in Florence was so great).   As I mentioned missed Positano and some cool museums  to name a few things!
5. As mentioned above, I probably over-thought the restaurants -- again except for those cant miss places you may have in your mind, most of the food can be dealt with same day -- we might pop into a restaurant around noon we wanted to eat for dinner and just place our reservation then.
6. Im sure there are good and bad days at FCO but I found that airport easy to navigate and efficient.   Dont stress too much about a madhouse  - it a tight operation all around.",t2_179bk5,Great first trip to Italy,0.93,65,1720369186.0,1720369186.0,30,jl0810,1dxkame
ItalyTravel," Hey guys. I am from Argentina and I have lived the last 8 months in Italy while working remotely since I have citizenship because of my grandfather. I really like this sub but lately I noticed there is a paranoia about being robbed or pickpockets. I can't say how many times I went to Rome since I was 1 hour by train from the centre and nothing happened. Me as a latinamerican guy I am used to be careful of my stuff. I have never had any problem. Pickpockets are opportunists. I told other people when they were close to them and those thieves did nothing. The police don't bother about them to avoid problems But they know that if they hit a tourist, they will be in a real problem, so feel free to warn others about them and they will run like cowards. Keep your stuff in your front pocket and don't leave your bag out of your sight. I know there are robberies in Napoli or the South. But come on is not Germany after WW2. Listen to the locals about the regions you could go or you couldn't and you will be ok. I can understand if you are from Switzerland but we all  have our own problems in our countries. In Italy you won't see people like zombies addicted to fentanyl. In the south you will see people who has not much to offer but if they have a piece of bread they will share it with you.And they are far more decent than many rich guys.   Of course  there are criminals like everywhere. But even if today the Mafia exists, we are not in the 80's so calm down it's not like the godfather. Unfortunately crime has increased with illegal immigration but this is a story for another day and a really complex situation. So just be careful, listen to the locals and please remember that you are a tourist and you are enjoying your time there which is amazing but there is also people who actually lives there. Don't enter in a church yelling and taking pics while they are having a mass, don't sit where you know you shouldn't, etc.
PD: remember that next year is the Jubilee, so Rome is a mess right now. See it as an opportunity to visit Less touristic places and close cities to the big ones like Tivoli or Castel Gandolfo. Rome is more than Trevi fountain and Vatican City. Italy is beautiful it's a dream. Is not la dolce Vita but is not Gomorra series either.

ItalyTravel,"Cremona and Parma are great smaller, less visited stops that you can easily include on the way from Milan to Bologna or Florence. 

Cremona is violin city - it's where Antonio Stradivari crafted his violins 300 years ago which today are valued at millions of dollars and are played by the best musicians in the world. The violin museum is a really fun half-day, they even have recitals on some incredible instruments there. Aside from the violin museum and violin shops, there's a cool cathedral and a lot of small streets to walk and enjoy. Could easily and happily spend a day and a half in Cremona. 

Parma had some of the best food we had during our whole stay. Great apertivo at Cafe Magnolia by the duomo, try the violet spritz! Parma had a lot of shops, cool walkable downtown area, and way fewer tourists than the bigger more famous cities. 

These smaller cities offer a lot in terms of culture and especially feeling more Italian. You're not at restaurants with tables full of Americans like in Rome lol. Not that there's anything wrong with that but after seeing the big sites, I think next time I will spend more time in the smaller cities.

ItalyTravel,"Hi, all. We’re wrapping up our trip( Venice-Tuscany-Matera-Puglia-Rome) and I wanted to share what we’ve learned on this trip. Hopefully you’ll find it helpful.

* Lockers are your friends. 

You have a few hours to kill before you can check in your Airbnb? Do yourselves a favor and rent a locker so you don’t have to lug around all your luggage. They often get booked out though, so make sure to book them in advance. 

* Small bags are also your friends. 

Planning a visit somewhere only for a day or two? Grab a small weekender bag where you can put in only what you’ll need for your short stay. We were so glad we packed our bag for our one night in Matera and left everything behind in our car.

* It’s difficult to park in the center of most major cities. Always plan to drive to a parking lot.

*Choose your esim wisely. 
 
I figured they’d be all the same and chose Maya, but sadly the reception I’ve been getting here in Rome has been pretty terrible. I couldn’t have got in touch with my husband, who was convinced that I had been murdered or mugged 🙄if it wasn’t this nice guy who turned on his hotspot for me to use. 

* Consider renting a golf cart for your parents who aren’t keen on walking.

It’s not something we did with our MIL, but they sure seem like a lifesaver!

* going to Amalfi Coast or Puglia? Plan to spend at least 4,5 nights

We spent 3 nights in Puglia and the weather wasn’t good enough for us to hop on a boat and explore some of the caves there. Allow yourselves more time since weather can be fickle.

Lastly not a tip, but I want to thank all the people who took the time to help us.

So many people helped us carry our toddler in a stroller up and down stairs. This guy who turned on hotspot for me to use. This person who gave a snack to our child fussing on the train. It makes me happy to be reminded that people can still choose kind. ",t2_8n11v3mi,What we’ve learned from our trip to Italy ,0.85,60,1726217468.0,1726217468.0,23,emily8922,1ffq1bn
ItalyTravel,"Husband and I (outdoorsy 30-somethings) just got back from the most magical 10 days of blitzing through Italy and I wanted to report back on how it all went! Itinerary report followed by general takeaways below. (: 

**May 5 (Rome)** - Landed at Rome airport around 9AM, bought tickets for the Leonardo Express / validated in station and then hopped on a train around 10ish, got to Termini for around 11AM if I remember correctly. Wandered from Termini to our airbnb in Trastavere with our backpacks on, walked through/past a lot of the sites we'd be seeing later on. Part of the walk took us down the steps so we were walking along the bank of the Tiber and wowowowowow. We were more wiped out than expected after the walk and ended up napping at our airbnb after we checked in (lol) and then put ourselves back together, did Rick Steves' audio tour of Trastavere, found a place to get dinner, and just kind of wandered around the neighborhood stopping to sip wine and eat tiramisu in different spots. It was incredible. 

**May 6 (Rome)** - Used [IT.TAXI](http://IT.TAXI) to call a car to bring us to the drop off point for our guided tour of the Vatican. I don't regret booking this because The Vatican is, ultimately, fucking insane in its offerings of art and history and whatnot, but this was easily the busiest/most crowded/suffocating thing we did the whole trip. There were so many people our tour ended up getting diverted from the Sistine chapel 2 or 3 times, which I actually liked because it meant we got to see EVERYTHING there was to see. I think we walked \~4 miles by the end of the tour. Tour started at 9:30 and we were walking out of St. Peter's at 13:00. Walked back to our bnb, passed out until 15:00, and then walked back into the heart of the city for our 17:45 Colosseum entry slot. Took our time getting there and let ourselves get distracted by any steps we wanted to run up or things we wanted to get closer to, etc. Waited behind maybe 5 people before getting our tickets checked for the colosseum, did Rick Steve's audio tour once inside, amazing. Originally we were planning on doing the forum afterwards but did not realize the forum closes early! Ended up spontaneously catching a bus to Appian Way and wandered around some of the park for sunset - not the part of the park we *meant* to wander around, but it was pretty nonetheless. Tried to catch a bus back but it never came, so we called another car via [it.taxi](http://it.taxi)  back to our neighborhood. Grabbed dinner and gelato. 

**May 7 (Rome)** - Hopped on a local bus to San Paolo train station, took a train out to Ostia Antica. Did the Rick Steve's audio tour (this is a running theme) and wandered the ruins for a couple of hours. The red poppies popping out of everything could make me cry, honestly. We were basically the only people there all morning. When we left around 11:00 there were hoards of schooltrips showing up, but we had the whole place to ourselves. Crazy. Hopped back on the train and took it to San Paolo, where we dipped into the metro and took a different train to the Colosseum area. Grabbed some street food and wandered - at midday this area is WAY more packed than in the late afternoon, like how it was the day before when we were there. The main line to the forum was stupid long, but there was no line at the Palatine Hill entrance just a little bit away from the Arch. We entered through there and wandered, did the Rick Steve's audio tour, wandered some more. Caught a bus to Campo d'fiori, and did most of Rick Steve's heart of rome walk. When we got to the pantheon we got in line to buy tickets - one of the machines was accepting money but was out of printer paper - we were able to snag one of the last printed tickets from the other machine around 17:00 and get inside the Pantheon. We ended up being two of like 10 people inside, this was a definite highlight. Did Rick Steve's pantheon audio tour and marveled at everything. Got kicked out around 17:45, continued the Heart of Rome walk and ended it ourselves at the Trevi Fountain. It was slammed but not hard to get close to the fountain itself. Walked back to Trastavere and watched sunset from one of the bridges over the Tiber. Wandered into a restaurant named something ending in ""il massi"" in trastevere - inadvertently one of the best meals of the whole trip. Hung out in Piazza Trilussa while a street performer played Bob Marley to a very happy crowd, went home, passed out. 

**May 8 (Rome -> Florence)** - Grabbed coffee and pastries and ate them in Piazza Trilussa after checking out of our bnb. Trekked up Janiculum hill (with our bags) and hung out there for about an hour taking in the incredible view before walking down the other side (towards the Vatican?) and catching a bus to Termini, where we hopped on a pre-booked bullet train from Rome to Florence. Walked from the train station to our place in Oltrarno, close to Pitti and Ponte Vecchio - felt a kind of like, culture shock, I guess? Rome and Florence are so, so different. We stayed in a really cool airbnb on the top floor of what used to be a tower, I think? There was a plaque out front. A lot of stairs to go up but definitely worth it. Dropped our stuff off, grabbed some gelato, made it over for our 17:15 tour time of Accademia to see David. The line situation was NUTS but there was a method to the madness. The poster scammers were EVERYWHERE. Once we got inside it was very cool - David does not disappoint - we did the Rick Steves audio tour and wandered. Once that was over we made our way back towards Oltrarno and realized we were close to Gustapizza and like \~15 minutes out from it opening. I'm not about to wait in line for hours for food, but I can wait 30 minutes. Got in the to-go line, ordered two pizzas right after they opened (husband went out and bough a bottle of wine in the meantime), and we ate the pizzas and drank the wine in the nearby piazza. This was one of my favorite meals. I fucking love a piazza.

**May 9** **(Florence)** - Slept in a bit! Did Rick Steve's Florence walk. Were originally going to do the duomo climb but changed our minds at the last minute - the amount of people waiting made it seem like it was going to be really claustrophobic - I don't regret this at all. Ended getting tickets to the Orsanmichele church / museum kind of on a whime (it was suggested in the Rick Steve's audio), I think 8 euros a pop. The church was beautiful, but the museum must be a state secret. We were the only 2 people in there, and the second floor is all HUGE windows with unobstructed views of the whole florence skyline, from within the skyline. It was dead quiet inside. No crowds. And incredible views. We soaked it up in here for a while, and then after the tour was done (around Palazza Vecchio), we wandered into San Frediano (I heard it was a cool area), got some of the best sandwiches from some random place, had Salciccia for the first time and didn't realize until we were like halfway through eating it (so good, omg), and hung out at a bar near a park for a while before catching a bus (I think 12) up to San Minianto. I read in a thread that this was a better viewpoint than the Piazzale Michelangelo with less crowds, and holy smokes. The view was insane. The monks closed the grounds right before sunset, but we were able to post up in one of the nooks in the wall right outside of the grounds and watch the sun go down. No crowd at all. Magical. Hiked back down on foot through Piazzale Michelangelo and stopped for a second to grab a beer and snap a photo, but it was SO so soooooooo crowded. Kept walking and wandered around Palazzo Vecchio area, grabbed dinner somewhere and headed home. 

**May 10 (Panzano)** - Got our rental car and made our way to Panzano for a lunch reservation at Dario's. I was worried this was going to be hokey or full of old people or something, but this ended up being a huge highlight. We were sat at a table with a bunch of guys weekending together from Milan, a couple from Brazil, and some other folks from Northern Italy, and we all just chatted and ate together and drank way too much chianti and stayed until we basically were asked to leave. It was amazing. What was supposed to be a two hour lunch turned into a six hour hang out. The food was incredible, obviously, but making friends with such an assortment of strangers was really, really special. Wandered around Panzano a little bit after we all parted ways and then made our way to the carpark in Florence. We had reserved a spot at a place a week or so in advance and paid once we got there in person, it was great. Grabbed some more of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life from some hole in the wall place in Oltrarno and hung out at our airbnb drinking wine until bedtime. 

**May 11**  **(Montepulciano)** - Slept in a bit! Grabbed a capuccino at the local spot we'd found near our place, got our rental car, and set off for a day spent wandering around in Montepulciano. Didn't really have a set in stone plan for the day, but we parked for free near a bus station and then caught a cheap shuttle up to the top of the town. Hopped off at the top (the driver could tell we had no idea where ""the top"" was going to be and kindly flagged us when we were supposed to get off), and really spent the whole day just wandering up and down the town. The wine was all very good, everywhere. The food also. And catching the sunset from the top was probably one of the most incredible sunsets I've seen anywhere ever. Highly recommend. Drove back after dark and the highway was CLOSED so we spent most of the drive on a very, very small road carrying diverted highway traffic in both directions. It was a little scary because of the buses and trucks, but we lived. Dropped our car off at the return lot, caught a tram back to termini, and walked back to our place. Got in around 23:00. LONG, beautiful day.  
  
**May 12 (Florence -> Cinque Terre)** - Got coffees at some third wave coffee shop instead of the usual spot because the usual spot was slammed and we had our bags with us - this place was fine but definitely geared towards Americans. And then walked to Termini and caught a train to Pisa, hopped out and switched platforms, and then caught a train to Monterosso Al Mare, landed around 15:00. Met up with our airbnb host, who was SO KIND, and walked up the 150 steps to the room we'd be staying in (not in the old side of town), it was amazing. Rooftop access. And tucked into the forested hill behind the other buildings. It was directly over the train but, surprisingly, that didn't bother us at all. We dropped our stuff off and wandered back out, got some foccaccia (holy shit) and walked into the old town. We wandered deep into the old town and up some road surrounded by vineyards and found some open but OLD woodsy staircase path that brought us up.... we did not know where we were going but did not care. Ended up popping out in the back of the cemetery at the top of the hill. Nobody was there, but if you walk \~50 meters or so away from the cemetery and down the road, there's an incredible panoramic viewpoint of the whole area. Wandered around here, then down an old-looking path around the cemetery that brought us to the front of the place, which is where the crowds (really not a lot of people) of people were. Wandered back down into the old town, bought some picnic-stuff from a local market (focaccia, pesto, olives, cheese, beer, limoncello) and then made our way home and picnicked on the rooftop while the sunset. Incredible day. 

**May 13 (Cinque Terre)** - I think this was my favorite day. I don't know. I'm a sucker for large bodies of water and generally just being in nature. We got down for breakfast around 10AM, and droves of people were getting off of the train to start the hike that everyone does. Currently only the Monterosso -> Vernazza -> Corniglia sections are open. We were planning on doing the hike first thing, but really, really didn't want to deal with the crowds of it all. So we bought our trail pass ticket and then decided to change our plans around. We ended up catching the ferry from Monterosso Al Mare and taking it down to Riomaggiore, 45 minute trip total (15 euros a head and you get to see every town from the water... so worth it), where we ran around a little bit and split a cone of fried anchovies from Tutti Frutti (10/10). Hopped on the train and took it to Corniglia, wandered around here a bit and then hopped on the hiking trail and hiked Corniglia -> Vernazza. Definitely recommend. The views were stunning, and we only saw a couple of people in either direction since we started a bit later in the day / I assume a bunch of people only do the first chunk of the hike when starting in Monterosso. The portion we did took us about 65 minutes, and we stopped to re-apply sunscreen and gawk at the views a couple of times. Did a quick lap in Vernazza but were itchy to get to the beach at this point, so hopped on the train to Monterosso, used our trail passes to get free access to the train bathrooms and change into our swimsuits (we brought a small, roll-up-able hiking sling bag for this purpose), bought a towel for 10 euros from one of the stalls near the beach and hit the free section of the beach in Fegina. Some folks but nothing crazy. Laid our stuff down and spent the afternoon swimming in the sea. The locals said the water was cold but it was beautiful - 69 degrees Fahrenheit or so - much warmer than the ocean water we're used to in California lol. After hanging out here until around 18:00 or so, we made our way back up to our room (150 steps!!!!!), showered, put ourselves together, and made it back out for dinner around 21:00. We were able to get a table at a restaurant in the old part of town and if I recommend any place, it's this one: Tosca Bistrot. The chef was out and about helping the waitstaff, she stopped and chatted with us for a bit, and the food was the best food we had the whole trip. Anchovies in lemon and oil, trufie with pesto, poached sea bass, tiramisu and a pinoleta, which is a tart I've never heard of or had but now cannot stop thinking about. It was amazing and special and sweet. Walked out of here and sat on the beach in the dark for a little bit near some street performers before making our way home. 

**May 14  (Cinque Terre -> Milan)** - I'm counting this as our last day even though technically we flew out of Milan on May 15. Initially we were going to spend two nights in Monterosso Al Mare but it felt dicey having to take a three hour train ride to a city where you then would have to catch a flight, so we opted to head to Milan to spend our last night before flying to limit any chance of craziness. We checked out of our bnb in the morning, spent a few hours wandering around with our bags, got some focaccia and ate it on the beach in the shade of the sidewalk overhand, and stopped at a local market to buy some fresh fruit for the train ride. This turned out to be a mistake. We bought two peaches, a nectarine, and some lemony cookies. Husband and I split the peaches and nectarine on the train ride, and just as we get to our hotel in Milan he starts complaining of nausea / upset stomach. He ended up having wild food poisoning. We washed the fruit before eating it but I guess something similar happened to him years ago when he was in Romania - something about his guts just not being familiar with the bacteria on the skin of the fruit or something. I was totally fine, but I historically have really strong guts. It ended up pouring rain the entire afternoon we were in Milan, anyway, so while it wasn't the most ideal way to end the trip it was also not the worst. Our hotel room was small enough that it was the perfect place for him to need to be close to a toilet, and we just opened the windows and listened to the rain and the locals being raucous into the night. Thankfully he was through it by morning and was able to get some sleep! But that was basically that!!! 

**BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS**  
- I have to assume this applies to anywhere, but our favorite moments / things really ended up being the little everyday things as opposed to the big tourist attractions. Like the local cafes we ended up going to every morning, hanging out in piazzas with the birds, chatting with people, and letting ourselves wander down any weird little path that caught our attention. And the gelato.  
- We tried our best to not over-schedule things and really only book the attractions we wanted to see instead of what we felt we HAD to see. We're not huge art people so we felt the Uffizzi and such would have been lost on us, were more interested in eating and hanging out with people so we prioritized that, etc.  
- Public transit is so wildly easy to use here that you should absolutely lean into relying on it. The bus schedules were pretty easy to read wherever they were posted, google maps' routes were usually spot-on, and if the bus doesn't show up (in Rome this seems to happen sometimes) and you don't want to walk, [it.taxi](http://it.taxi) worked just like uber.  
- If you can book the BIG ATTRACTIONS towards the end of the day, do it. Crowds are thinner and you have a better chance of smaller numbers being inside. We booked Colosseum/Forum/Palatine Hill pass + Vatican (with a tour) + Accademia + time slot to Ostia Antica in advance and let ourselves sort of figure out the rest of the day-to-day as best we could.  
- Aside from lodgings and the car rental, the only other thing we booked in advance was the bullet train. It was pretty packed so I recommend you do the same, plus I think it's cheaper if you book it in advance.   
- Idk if Rick Steves gets a bad rap or whatever but as two people who didn't WANT to book tours to everything and also could not afford to book tours to everything, the guided Rick Steves walks were amazing. They give you so much context to wherever you are and there were absolutely some things we saw - a completely empty church with a beautiful rose garden and singing nuns comes to mind - that we never would have stumbled upon without them. Definitely recommend. Husband and I literally just split a pair of airpods, made sure to download the audio tours when we were on wifi, and listened and walked. In this vein, definitely bring a good portable charger. 

I can honestly say this was a magical, life altering trip for me. I have never taken two weeks to just go have fun somewhere like I did with this, and it was amazing. Ultimately I think the most important thing is not letting yourself be too tied to a schedule, giving yourself some leeway/grace, figuring out specifically what's important for YOU to see, and just leaning in to living in wherever you are. It was amazing. I wish we had more time and I can't wait to go back.

If you want any specific recs (food, gelato, lodging, etc) in any of the places we were, feel free to message me!! 

  
EDIT: additionally takeaway: forgot to explicitly mention this but husband and I each ONLY brought one backpack and I stand by this move 100000%. It made getting places on travel days way easier, made us pack smarter, and was honestly a great way to live. We did some sink laundry and I made sure to book a bnb midway through the trip (Florence) with laundry facilities. We brought some rope to hang our clothes. I felt awful for everyone I saw using rolling suitcases in Rome on the cobblestone.

ItalyTravel,"So as the title says I wanted to thank Reddit for the insights ahead of our first trip to Italy. We had a fantastic trip, and I thought I might share some of our observations in the hopes other travelers might take away something useful. 
My wife (F54) and I (M55) went for our 30th anniversary, flying into and out of Milan. We packed super light (only carry on bags) and did laundry at spots along the way.  We used the train to go to Venice, picking up a rental car after for the rest of the trip. 

First, I don’t know if it was posted and I missed it but graffiti is EVERYWHERE.  We got spooked at first thinking we were in a bad area but graffiti is just kinda everywhere. 

Driving is not horrible. I was actually much more comfortable once we had our car. I found the stress of trains and the like - pick pocket fears, late or missed connections, lugging around EVERYTHING we had- to be way more stressful than driving. The trunk allowed us to expand our luggage ( compression cubes for the win ) holding dirty clothes etc. and the magic talking box ( GPS ) was perfect. And in English.  As others have said rent the smallest car you can- we had a Fiat 500 hybrid and it was perfect for us. Slow as heck but still had a trunk that hid our stuff, was small enough to fit most places and got about 61 MPG.  The driving isn’t super aggressive I didn’t think, it seemed more sloppy most times- lanes and parking spaces are more of a rough suggestion.  Also, if you get your AAA international license you can use the Cooltra electric rental vespas. They were worth their weight in gold. Cheap to rent, let us leave the car parked in the city’s and really expand your freedom and what’s doable in a day. 

All the food pointers here were great, but tip culture is in full effect. I don’t know if it’s because we really stood out as tourists,  or just standard programming for CC swiping but I think we were asked for a tip every day. The Bologna restaurants recommend were unparalleled. 

Skip the line tickets were hit or miss, with more hits than misses.  Of all the walking tours, guided outings and reserved transportation only three were total busts, and of those one was honestly likely weather related. 

Not an expert by any means, but if anyone wanted to ask a noob for their thoughts feel free. We went Milan , Venice ,  The Dolomites , Lake Guarda, San Remo, Bologna , Florence , Tuscany , Rome , Amalfi Coast and back to Milan.

She FLIPPED out on me saying it was too personal and that it was out of her mind that I had the audacity to ask. She said everyone asks the same questions from all over, and she asked me why I wanted to know and why tourists always asks the same question. She was very open about her family history and other stuff, so I was blown away by the reaction. Had anyone else had this experience? I felt awful and apologized, but she scolded me like a child.

ItalyTravel,"Ciao! Just back home from a 10 day (very busy) trip. I visited with my partner and our goal was to see as much as possible within our reasonable budget.

I'll share our itinerary with the hoped to inspire anyone who is planning on visiting. Will also share some thoughts about the trip including some negatives that I found.

We flew into Venice and spent 2 days there. We got a water taxi to the center and was immediately impressed with the views. It was our first time in Italy and already we were getting good vibes (more on the vibes in each city later)

On trying to check into our apartment (which we booked on booking.com and everything else on our trip), we faced a really shitty check in experience. The place was called Granda Sweet Suites, avoid at all cost btw, can share more details on this if anyone wants to know more. Once checked in we made our way to a few of the main spots but as it was late we never really could go in anywhere so just looked at them from the outside. Headed to dinner and then made our way home for the first night. We got our first run in with some mosquitos and had a few bites already.

Our second day we did a boat trip to Murano and Burano. The tour we did took us to a workshop and it was amazing to see a master glass blower at work. What we didn't realise was that it was only an hour on the island and after the demonstration it was pretty much 45 mins in a gift shop. Unfortunately we spent most of the time choosing gifts for back home so didn't have time to explore the island. Overall, the boat trip was beautiful and we absolutely adored Burano - wish we spent more time on both islands :)

We finished our last evening in Venice with a lovely meal and honestly found everyone we interacted with lovely and found everyone very safe.

Next morning we got the train from Venice to Florence. We spent 3 days here. Initial differences we noticed is that there is there's now car / bike / scooter agains lol but the vibe was much different to Venice. I really loved the vibe here and everyone was super positive & helpful.

We spent the next few days visiting Accamedia museum, the duomo and even a morning trip to Pisa (we just wanted to see the tower and spend more time in Florence).  One thing that stood out was the Boboli gardens, I'd recommend big time and was such a different pace to the busy city center.

On our 6th day we took the train to Rome. Trains was delayed which had a small knock on against our original plans, so I'd advise to not book anything very close together on the days of travel. We thankfully didn't miss out on anything booked but just a thought.

We visited the Coliseum and Roman Forum. Our booking was 4pm and the area shuts I think about 7 so really wasn't a lot of time to fully visit everything. The Coliseum didn't take that much time to be honest but we would have loved to spend more time exploring the Forum a bit more but we did what we could. We did catch David Gilmour doing sound check at the Circus Maximus so that was pretty cool to see / hear.

Next day, we spent at the Vatican. Honestly what a beautiful place and probably highlight of our trip. If I was to do this again I'd try get the earliest time possible to visit the Vatican and spend an entire day here. We couldn't get early tickets so we had a noon ticket open bus tour which gave access to everything.

We also accidentally missed the Creation of Adam when in the Sistine Chapel and had to re walk the full thing again to see it on the second time round the loop.

What we didn't realise before was that St Peters Basicalla requires you to leave the Vatican city and walk around to the entrance, which requires a reinspection of your bags and a large queue.

We then left Rome for Napoli. After another train delay, we arrived in Napoli central and wow, what a vibe shift !! We were immediately shocked at the noise, homelessness, dirt, rubbish. Random people came up to us and honestly first time we never felt safe in our trip. We maybe stayed in a bad area but honestly was not expecting this from Naples after everything good we heard before. To top it all off we had ants in our room and woke up itchy as hell from likely all the bites we got whilst sleeping!

We really struggled with the crossings and found it dangerous as you essentially had to step out at the cross points and even then most of the time the scooters didn't stop. We also spotted an older man get his foot ran over and the bike just continued on like he does that every day.

The sirens. How can I forget about the sirens. There were constant. Never seen so many ambulances and police flying down the street!

The general vibe was chaotic and just generally crazy. It could just be me who felt overwhelmed with it all but on the other hand I can see why some people could like the buzz it had.

We had a pre booked day trip to Mount Vesuvius and Pompeii. It was stunning and I'd highly recommend doing that as it's unbelievable. We wished we had more time in Pompeii and would have loved to spend a full day there itself. The tour had some time restrictions so if I was to do it again I'd split the tours and do a single day in Pompeii. I heard good things about Herculaneum but never got a chance to visit.

On our last day we did the hop on / hop off bus tour which took us out the center and I was so impressed with the scenery and felt like an entirely different vibe to city center. With hindsight probably should have stayed outside of the city but will be back.

Overall, I'd recommend the visit to anyone and I'll definitely be back. Next on the list is Amalfi coast, possibly Sorrento, Capri and surrounding islands.

Our itinerary was Lake Como, Milan, Tuscan Countryside, Florence, and Rome.  We used a travel agent (who is fantastic) and found us the best hotels in the best locations.  My wife and I are huge sports fans, and we attended an Inter Milan match at San Siro and went to the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.  Both were fantastic!  

We rented a boat on Lake Como, dined at some amazing restaurants, had private guided tours in Siena and Rome, did luxury shopping in Milan, and had about 100000 spritzes.  To top it off, I had to go to the hospital on the last day because I had severe swelling in my foot.  It was nothing, but the ordeal left me in awe.  A doctor saw me within five minutes, had bloodwork, imaging, and meds, and the bill was less than $250.  

I laugh at all of the ""is Italy safe, will I be robbed, scammed, etc"" posts.  Italy is EXTREMELY safe.  If you live in the USA, you are safer in Italy by almost any metric.  I think a lot of these worries are from people who live in the suburbs and aren't comfortable in cities.  My wife and I are active and social and were out late in the evening.  Never once did we feel uneasy.  Just like anywhere else, keep your wits about you, and you will be fine.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone,
My husband and I have been trying to conceive for a while. However, as the title says, we just started our 1.5 month long vacation in Italy last Saturday and found out on the third day that we’re finally pregnant! I’m a FTM (4-5 weeks along) in a foreign country (I’m Canadian) so I’m a little out of my depth of what to do. 

My family doctor in Canada says that I am to book an appointment with an OB or midwife when I come back but by then I would be 10 or 11 weeks along. I know women usually have an ultrasound appointment around 5-8 weeks and was wondering if anyone has an advice for where to go/what to get checked while I am here.

What clinics are in the Anzio/Nettuno/Latina areas would you recommend to schedule an ultrasound? I’d even be willing to travel to Rome if needed. Are foreigners able to receive prenatal treatment? If so, what would I need to bring? What are the costs? I do have a Codice Fiscale (though mine has my old last name before I got married and I havnt changed it yet to my new official one - not sure if this will affect my ability to get medical help). My husband speaks some Italian which has been helping us communicate. 

Honestly any advice for the next month for how to check on our baby would be greatly appreciated! I’m really happy but also a bit scared as I wasn’t expecting to get pregnant this early into the trip 😅.

ItalyTravel,"Just returned from two awesome weeks in Italy! 

Before the report out, never once did we experience anything that made us concerned for our safety or wellbeing. Everyone we encountered went from the standard European reaction to tourists up to the nicest people I have ever met. We followed the security and safety tips from Rick Steves, including the money belt. After settling in, the money belt felt like overkill, but I figured it was better to be safe. Kept a bunch of cash, a spare credit card, and my passport there. Metros, cabs, busses, etc were all totally fine and completely normal if you are used to public transit and public transit in any major city. 

*Rome* 
Loved it. We booked two food tours with Eating Europe, and they were awesome. We were so happy with investing time in the food experience. Completely and totally worth it. The major sites were great, of course, but overall we had the most meaningful experiences at the places a lot of tourists don’t go to. Keeping in mind it was October and November, so crowds were less in general, getting away from the big sites will reward you with far fewer people. We walked the Via Appia Antica last Sunday and it was incredible. When you get to the sections of ancient paving and tombs, it felt like we were transported back in time. The Palazzo Massimo museum by Termini had no one there and the most amazing mosaics and frescos I have seen. Shout out to the garden room…not to mention the Boxer at Rest. I spent 6 hours at Ostia Antica and had the most powerful experience of the trip. Again, almost no one there. More of it is intact than Pompeii, including accessible second and third stories of buildings. Often I would find myself completely alone on a full street of the ruins. The positive thing about the crowds at the major sites is that all the people give you a sense of what they would have been like in Ancient Rome. Take the Colosseum, for example. It was built to hold massive crowds. So crowds of tourists sort of make it feel the way it was supposed to. Ostia, being mostly empty, was the first time I was in a ruin and felt an overwhelming loneliness and sadness. Clearly a place once full of life, now empty. It was amazing. 

*Naples* 
Bella chaos. The archaeological museum was awesome. Shout out to the Ancient Roman bread they make at the museum cafe. We used the Rick Steves audio guide for the museum to help filter through all of the amazing collections. Highly recommend it. It’s like you are given permission to move on from things so as to not be completely burned out. 

*Pompeii and Vesuvius* 
We did a small guided tour (Sorrento Food Tours) of the ruins, lunch at a winery at the base of the volcano, and a trip to the top of Vesuvius. This was my third time in Pompeii, but my partner’s first time. For me, the guided tour, which was only two hours, was too surface level given my past trips. But for my partner, it was perfect because she was overwhelmed by how much there was to see. Being there at the end of October was perfect. 

*Herculaneum* 
The ruins at Herculaneum were awesome to explore. It’s the only place you can see preserved structural wood. It’s much smaller and again, less visited, than Pompeii, and definitely worth the visit. The skeletons in the old beach front warehouses…no words. 

*Sorrento* 
Our home base for our time in the south. It was so nice to come back to Sorrento at the end of the day to relax and have dinner. Shout out to the Inn Bufalito with a Mozzarella Bar. 

*Some logistical notes* 
- We used the high speed rail from Rome to Naples which was a delight. Sprung for the business class tickets, included a free meal pack, drinks, and some espresso from a little espresso cart. Worth the extra €5. 

- We used the Campania Express to get from Naples to Sorrento. Honestly, the best part about it was that you had room to put your luggage. Yes, it’s just a standard metro train. Maybe the AC works, maybe it doesn’t. Sure, the time it saves you isn’t much. But if you have a suitcase, it’s worth it. It either broke down or the crew was on strike when we needed to get back to Naples to leave, so we took the ferry instead. A delight. Took about 35 min, tons of room, a little snack bar. The cab from the port to the station to take the train back to Rome was easy. I’m honestly going to do the ferry if we go back. 

- Cabs. All were fine and we never felt ripped off. If you want to pay with card, definitely ask before you get in. We started using FREENOW eventually and that was fine. Felt overpriced but you’re paying for convenience. 

- Leonardo Express from the airport was easy and affordable. Highly recommend. 

*Things I’ll do differently next time* 
- This is the second time I used a cheap eSIM for data only coverage. Moving forward I’m just going to pay more for my carrier’s international package. A few times I really needed to make a call, and couldn’t. This is more general travel than Italy specific. 

- I’ll probably skip the big sites. Reiterating, our most meaningful moments were at the smaller or less visited places. The sheer number of smaller museums in Rome is honestly crazy. And they seem awesome. 

- The one time we needed flexibility with a train ticket happened to be the ticket we paid extra money to add flexibility. We got super lucky on that. Next trip trip to Italy we agreed that it is definitely worth it to pay the higher ticket prices for a flex ticket. For anything that allows you to. Because things just run a bit different. 

*Note for nervous Americans* 
- Italy is far from a difficult place to travel to and through. With that said, I would not go there as your first international trip planned on your own. As part of a tour group, totally fine for a first international trip. I would build up your travel soft skills in a place like Ireland or the UK first to be honest. There are a lot of transferable things you learn in large European cities you can apply anywhere in the continent and it’s easier to learn those if you're in a place that speaks your language and works with a similar set of rules. Similarly, if you have never visited a large/major city or used public transportation before, Italy isn't the best place to learn. Take a long weekend to visit some large American city, take public transportation, take a cab. Figure that all out here before going to Italy. So many complaints I read from fellow Americans about Italy are complaints about things that end up just being normal parts of life in a big city. 

- And definitely do your research before going. We bought and read all of the Rick Steves books, plus this Subreddit, plus lots of YouTube and travel documentaries. The work you put in before you go will become very apparent to you, and the Italians, once you get there. 

- Overall, just respect the fact that you are in someone else's home, and act accordingly. Respect others, their way of life, and go in with curiositiy. 

Overall, I can’t say enough about how awesome our time was there. Can’t wait to go back! 

*Edit to add one more tip:* Before we left, my partner made a Google map of all of the restaurants and small sites recommended by Rick Steves, this sub, any of the YouTube videos we watched, etc. for both cities we stayed in. That way, as we were out just strolling around, if we were hungry or wanted to see something, we could pull up the map and see what was close that was already vetted. This worked out for us so many times, especially with food. She was sure to put the source of the recommendation in the Google map note too. The corollary point here is that we spent a lot of time doing unstructured wandering, which I would strongly recommend rather than packing a bunch of stuff in.

EDIT: Here is my itinerary:

Venice: Stayed at Ca’Piasentin – loved it. Dinner at 6342 Alla Corte Ristorante – very good, steak tartar was great.

Visited: Duce Palazza (amazing), Museo Correr – tickets in advance.

Cicchetti crawl: Cantina Vecia Carbonera -> Alla Vedova -> Decanter Vineria -> Osteria al Tappo -> Cantina Schiavi -> Aea Canevassa -> Cantina Do Mori -> Bacaro al Ravano -> Ostaria dai Zemei -> OSTERIA ALL’ARCO -> Cantine del Vino già Schiavi -> CANTINA AZIENDE AGRICOLE -> Antica Osteria Ruga Rialto -> Antica Osteria Ruga Rialto - Bacarando Corte dell'Orso -> Bacaro ae Bricoe -> Vino Vero -> Osteria Santa Giustina -> Birreria Zanon (any of these are good). Just getting out of the main streets at around 4-5 pm and going bar hopping was amazing. Favorite activity was just walking around and drinking wine. Wines in Venice are some of the best.

Florence: visit Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella (store).

Museums: Galleria degli Uffizi, Galleria dell'Accademia – tickets in advance

Dinner: Osteria Antica Casa Torre – very good, rabbit was excellent; Belcore – extra excellent – real foie gras, risotto.

BABAE – wine – great experience

Mercato Centrale (food market) - best for lunch every day!

Went to opera at Teatro del Maggio Musicale – great experience.

Certaldo: visited for a festival, maybe not worth visiting because it is on a hill and very very small.

Cinque Terre: stayed at Riomaggiore (best town as a base) at AWroom – great place!

Dinner: da Eraldo in Monterosso – excellent, especially traditional seafood pasta. Yes, this area is touristy, but I really liked it because tourists don't bother me, it's very picturesque, the water is warm, and I did some great shopping there for women's clothes. They also have great fish and chips - definitely should try that. I was there for two days.

ItalyTravel,"Just wrapped up my 16 day trip, thought I'd write up a report of some scams/bad business practices I encountered. Nothing particularly unique to Italy but good to be aware of regardless of where anyone would be traveling to:

• Before my trip an Airbnb host attempted a bait and switch by confirming my reservation in Rome a month prior to my trip then messaging me two weeks before saying the room is unavailable and they can provide an alternative. A quick Google lens search showed they were offering the room at a higher rate on booking.com so they double booked it, which is against Airbnb terms of service. Since I don't want to stay in a place that I didn't agree to I contact Airbnb and they quickly resolved it and offered a 20% off to rebook elsewhere.

• Upon returning a rental car at Locauto MXP (operating under Alamo brand) the manager of the place inspected the car and suggested to the employee that I be liable for a tiny chip of paint the size of a BB since it wasn't previously reported. I immediately pulled out a video walk around and showed that tiny speck was pre-existing. They agreed and didn't charge me anything (yet).

• Witnessed a snatch and run of a fake purse from one of the African street vendors near Trevi. Kind of an odd thing to steal considering it's an empty fake purse. For only being in Rome for 24 hours I was surprised to see petty theft. Not too surprising for a city though, here in NYC I see shoplifting everytime I walk into a Target.

• Took a taxi from Hilton FCO to Hilton Garden Inn FCO (4 km) and the driver charged me €25 claiming it was the minimum for FCO despite us never leaving airport property and only driving 8 minutes (meter showed €13). Taxi prices are regulated and this ""minimum"" is not a thing. I briefly argued with the guy while he held our bags ransom in the trunk. I intentionally paid with a credit card with the intention of disputing it later. Ran a chargeback on my VentureX today for the €12 I was overcharged and it was immediately resolved.

TL:DR Document the hell out of everything with photos and screenshots. Also use credit cards for everything, bank customer support is easier to deal with than a crooked taxi.",t2_61l5jxk1,Scams/Bad Business I encountered,0.92,54,1729628421.0,1729628421.0,30,NugsOrBust,1g9s0g5
ItalyTravel,"While researching for our recently concluded trip to Italy, I struggled to find concise answers to all the doubts I had about renting and driving a car. Now that I’ve experienced it myself I though I’d note down everything I know in as much detail as I can remember. We drove almost 900kms in the Tuscan countryside. We stayed in a small place called Palaia and drove to Pisa, Lucca, La Spezia, San Gimignano and Siena. Most roads were a treat to drive on; gently winding and super scenic. There were some rough patches on the inner roads but nothing too bad.

All in all we had a blast driving through the scenic beauty of Tuscany and I highly highly recommend it to anyone on the fence about it.

**Car rental:**

We booked Avis through Auto Europe and chose the Mini Category (“Fiat 500 or similar”). We did a pick up and drop at Florence airport to ensure we avoid any city traffic or ZTLs on the way to Palaia. I was told by an acquaintance to take the smallest possible car for 2 of us and it was absolutely the right decision. Parking and navigating small roads was a breeze. I was very surprised with the amount of boot space. With the rear seats folded down the car could easily fit 3 large check in bags and change, more than enough for the 2 of us. The 500 held up very well at highway speeds as well though acceleration beyond 80-90 kmph is unenthusiastic so overtaking had to be well thought out. Nevertheless, it held up very nicely cruising at 110-120kmph. To collect the car we took the free shuttle from right outside the exit of Florence airport; signs are clearly marked. It was a small shuttle so one might have to wait for the next one if there’s a lot of crowd. Reached the Avis office and took a number, each person takes about 10 mins. The staff was very polite and had no problem conversing in English. Not sure if this is the case every time but we got to choose our car from 3 options available. The lady at the counter asked for my passport, domestic driver’s license and a credit card with my name on it. They didn’t ask for my International Driver’s Permit but I handed it to her anyway. They hold an approx. 200 Euro security deposit on the card which is promptly returned when you drop off the car and they give the all clear. We took very comprehensive pictures and videos of the car to document every little scrape and scratch before we got in. The car was largely in good condition, only a few small scratches here and there. It was very straightforward to navigate from the car park to get out of Florence and onto the Highway.

Filled up the car with a full tank from a small pump a few kilometers from the lot as we realized it was approx. 55 euros for a full tank and Avis charges 75 euros if you return it less than full. The return process was very smooth and took about 5 mins in total. Note: Google maps couldn’t direct us to the car rental lot properly, so we ended up having to go to the airport and following the Shuttle to the lot and we ended up missing our train to Venice due to this. So budget extra time for such anomalies.

**Highway and Country road driving:**

Road conditions varied from patchy B roads to super smooth tolled highways. Almost everyone drives +10 of the limit at minimum, even in the slow lane. But keep an eye out for speed cams, which are usually indicated with a board saying “Velocita Controllata Elettronicamente” so that you have enough time to watch your speed. After overtaking, move back to the right lane as soon as you can because there’s most likely someone faster than you waiting to go ahead. People do drive fast but we never found anyone to be aggressive. Even on twisty roads there was no pressure from drivers behind to speed up or move out of the way. If they want to, they will overtake you when they get a chance. Junctions, exits and roundabouts have clearly marked signs. Drivers are systematic and follow rules for the most part so driving is less stressful.

**Parking lots:**

All car parks we went to had boards outside showing availability of free spots. Credit Cards were accepted at all of them.

 

Pisa: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/581bBfTznuMMcS2H6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/581bBfTznuMMcS2H6)

Just a 2 minute walk to the leaning tower complex; safe, secure and reasonable rates. It’s a small parking lot but cars move out regularly. Here you take a ticket upon entry and pay on your way out.

 

Lucca: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/uPkU1PRumBtuZvqx9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uPkU1PRumBtuZvqx9)

Almost right across the street from the entrance to the old town. Huge parking space so you are almost guaranteed to find a spot. Here you park your car and then find the ticket booth in the middle of the lot. Follow the instructions on the screen (there’s an option for English as well) and choose how long you want to park till and pay accordingly before heading out. Once you get your ticket you need to display it inside your car on the dashboard or tucked into the driver’s side window.

 

Cinque Terre/ La Spezia: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/mqrYgJyq95tCtmn57](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mqrYgJyq95tCtmn57)

We took the train to CT from La Spezia Station. This was a free parking lot we happened upon with just 1 spot left. It was a 10-15 minute walk from the station.

 

San Gimignano: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/1eTfoWZCvoKjxhEs9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1eTfoWZCvoKjxhEs9)

When entering, there are ample signs for the parking lots called P1, P2, P3, P4. We went to P3/P4 and though there was quite a line to enter, it took about 15 mins to get a spot as cars go in and out regularly. Remember to take the ticket with you when leaving your car as you have to pay up at the booth before getting into your car and leaving.

 

Siena: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/bfBLu3t3C7nMWZqE9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bfBLu3t3C7nMWZqE9)

This lot had a series of escalators close by that took you right to the old town of Siena. It was a big lot with quite a few empty spots. Again remember to take the ticket with you when leaving your car as you have to pay up at the booth before getting into your car and leaving. And the payment booth is at the foot of the escalators and not around the car park as we found out the hard way!

 

**Navigation:**

Found Google maps to be quite accurate in the Tuscan countryside. Missed a few turns and exits through our driving but we were always rerouted quick enough or were able to turn around on smaller roads.

ItalyTravel,"I've been in Italy for about 10 days, and I'm going through a moment of deep depression. I am a single 29 year old woman who has always struggled with weight. I was 265lbs before the summer and am now 230lbs and am proud of my success! 

Although the success of losing weight, I am disheartened and saddened here in Italy. There are so many beautiful women and I feel ugly. I am 5'8, 230lbs, and I don't fit in many of the chiq stores around. I just feel the shame of my weight and how I look so hard right now and am very sad.***deleted eat, pray, love comment*** I know overall I'm pretty, just over weight, but here... Idk. 

Anyone have any insight? Thanks 🩷

1. I appreciate all the kind words from many of you here!

3. Now the mention to the movie (didn't know it was a book), eat pray love, I never saw it. Like I said, my friends mentioned it, and put into my head some expectations I didn't origianally have. They had to explain the movie and that it's about a woman who travels on her own and has a life changing trip. That's what I was meaning when I referenced it. 
4. Tonight I met some great people. Mostly local in Rome and some from Firenze! I put on some gorgeous clothes, did my hair and makeup, and made an effort to stop being a total ass to myself.

ItalyTravel,"So I was recently in Naples and had originally planned to metro to my hotel but found out my train line was closed so I was forced to get a taxi. Because I was a bit nervous being a solo female in Naples very late at night, instead of booking the car through Uber or the phone, I went to the taxi stand (mistake, I Know).

The man drove me 10 minutes (less than 5 miles) and according to his end odometer (I didn’t check it at the start of the journey), it cost 27.50 euros! I was surprised but then I asked to pay by credit card and he said no! 😒 I read on this subreddit that people have said this happens but you need to tell them they have to take credit. I told him I could only pay credit and had no cash but he kept refusing and wouldn’t let me go anywhere and then proceeded to drive me to an ATM, ushered me out the car, and stood next to the door waiting for me to withdraw money.

I ended up getting the cash so I handed him a 50 bill expecting my change and he actually just handed me 20 euros back. I told him I wanted all of my change and he said “no, it’s a tip for me” 🙄

Honestly, because it was a horrible experience for me, on my return back to Napoli Centrale, I decided to book through Uber and selected the option through ITaxi and the entire trip was 15 euros.

Lesson learned—if you can, book through Uber. It’s a guaranteed price limit and you can track where your car is driving. Just make sure to either select via ITaxi or Uber Black or you’ll get random drivers who might scam you (read about a scam earlier on this subreddit).",t2_31mkusli,Bad Taxi Experience and Tips,0.92,56,1715717215.0,1715717215.0,38,pandada_,1cs1qv8

ItalyTravel,"My wife and I just finished our 1 year anniversary trip to Italy and it was the time of our lives. I was able to create the itinerary and plan everything based off of reading trip reports on here. In the spirit of paying it forward; here is a detailed itinerary of our trip and tips/tricks for planning. A few details for context:
- 30 m and 30 f 
- Budget of $10,000
- Live in downtown of a top 3 largest city in the US
- I was in the military for 6 years and spent a majority of that time abroad so I have good bit of travel experience
- The trip was from mid to late September. The crowds were not nearly as bad as expected. Weather was incredibly mild and luckily no rain the entire trip.
- Cities visited Rome, Venice, Amalfi coast 

Travel: cost of $2,340 for 2 round trip flights
ORD-MUN-FCO. We booked tickets about 5 months in advance. We both got off work at 5pm CST and took a 9pm flight. We connected in Munich so we had a small layover of 3 hours but it wasn’t bad. If you have the AMEX platinum card and are flying Lufthansa then you can get into their business class lounge for free. The nighttime flights are great since you can just sleep the entire time. We arrived in FCO the next day at 7pm.

Day 1 (Rome): Thursday
We arrived in Rome at 7pm on a Thursday and took an Uber to our airbnb in Monti. Uber books through a separate taxi company and it’s about a 58€ cost from FCO to the center of Rome. We had just finished about 17 hours of travel so we got dinner and gelato and passed out. 

Day 2 (Rome): Friday
The jet lag was rough so we woke up later than we wanted at around 11am and got going. We visited trevi fountain at 1115am, Spanish steps at 1230am, and plaza del popolo at 2pm. We stopped for a quick late lunch near plaza del popolo. There are a ton of restaurants in the area. Just pull out google maps and set your filter to top rated and whatever price point you are comfortable with. We had a tour of the Vatican scheduled for 3pm with livtours. There was a small group of 6 of us and the tour was perfect. Our guide was knowledgeable and gave us insights that would have taken a lot of time to find on our own. The tour took us through the Sistine chapel and St. Peter’s basilica. My wife and I are Catholic so this had a lot of meaning to us but I think most would find it beautiful and a worthwhile visit. A lot of things were under construction for Jubilee happening next year but we didn’t really mind. The tour took about 3 hours. By this time we were exhausted and headed home to sleep at 6pm. Overall we walked about 35,000 steps this day. We did not take any public transportation the entire time. Rome is incredibly walkable and in my opinion a great way to see the city. We stopped in multiple basilicas and loved seeing so many of them when we would have just passed by in a bus or car. 

Day 3 (Rome): Saturday
We woke up at 7am and had a quick breakfast before walking to the colosseum. I booked tickets for this online and had everything ready to go on apple wallet. It opens at 8:30am and we arrived at that time to see a line about a quarter mile long. We got in line and it only took about 10 minutes to actually get in. It’s pretty awesome to see in person especially being a fan of the movie “Gladiator”. We walked through in about 1 hour and walked over to the Roman forum. The tickets we had were full access for $18 per person. Gets you into palatine hill, Roman forum, and colosseum. The Roman forum was fun to walk through. Palatine hill gave great views of the city. It was about 2pm when we started to make our way over to trastavere. This is an amazing neighborhood of restaurants and shops. We then walked to plaza navona and the pantheon, mass in the pantheon was beautiful. After that we walked down via del corso and did some shopping for family before getting dinner and heading home.we passed by plaza Venezia but it was under heavy construction. We walked another 35,000 steps this day. Between the two days we covered pretty much the entire main area of Rome and walked around 35 miles. 

Day 4 (Travel to Venice): Sunday
We woke up and had breakfast before going to Rome termini. We each had a duffle bag and a backpack so we were very mobile and had no issues walking to Rome Termini from our airbnb in Monti. I booked train tickets through the Italo train app and the whole process was so efficient and smooth. I booked tickets about 3 weeks in advance and they cost about 60$ per person. The whole trip was about 4 hours to Venice and we just enjoyed the views the entire time. When we arrived in Venice it was about 5pm and our hotel was on MURANO. We got tickets to the public transit for 48 hours and hopped on a boat to go to MURANO. Another plug for Amex platinum: we booked nh collection MURANO and used the 200 dollar hotel credit and 100 dollar beverage credit at the hotel. It was only 250 for us to stay there for 2 nights after all of the credits were applied. We didnt mind staying on MURANO because it was cheaper and the public transit was so good. We headed back into town for dinner and it was so good. We then went to a bar to have a few drinks and ended up running into really nice British people. We talked for a while until the bar closed at 2am. We were stuck and didn’t see any public transit running. Luckily a young guy with his own boat was picking up his friend and we asked if he could take us back to MURANO and he said he would for 50€. We agreed and were not in a place to negotiate haha. He was a good guy for helping us out. 

Day 5 (Venice): Monday
We woke up at 10am a little hungover and walked around the glass shops on MURANO while drinking coffee for an hour or so. We then hopped on the public transit and headed to Venice. We got some pizza and got a gondola ride. The gondola was near the Rialto bridge and you had to wait in a queue but it didn’t take long. This is something you just walk up and do for 90€ total. It’s romantic and a lot of fun. We would have probably done it even if it wasn’t our anniversary. We then walked over to st Maria basilica. The basilica charged 5€ per person to get in but it was beautiful and worth it. Then we walked to San Marco square. The San Marco square was under construction but there was great live music and it was the perfect place for an aperol spritz before dinner. We went back to our hotel at 9pm to make up for staying out all night the night before. We walked another 35,000 steps this day after trying to see all of Venice in one day. Overall we were satisfied with what we were able to see and felt like one day in Venice was enough for us.

Day 6 (travel to amalfi coast): Tuesday
We took an Italo train from Venezia st Lucia to Salerno. The trip cost about 80$ per person on the app for the business seats. The train ride was about 6 hours but was a lot of fun. We read books and had good views of the mountains the whole way. We arrived at about 7pm in Salerno and needed to get to San Michele where our airbnb was. I found a private driver on Reddit and contacted him on WhatsApp. He picked my wife and I up at Salerno train station and drove us to our airbnb for 140€ which was a great price compared to what others were quoting. He was a really nice guy and we talked for the entire hour and a half. Once we arrived in San Michele, my wife and I got a quick dinner and went to bed before exploring amalfi coast the next day. 

Day 7 (Amalfi): Wednesday
I picked up a scooter at 9am from Amalfi Coast Rent Scooter.  The scooter really made the trip. We paid 180€ for 3 full days. We had complete freedom and we were able to go along the entire coast. I had some prior scootering experience in Asia so this was not too different of an experience. My wife was able to enjoy the view while I had fun scootering to each town. We had a boat tour reservation scheduled to depart from Amalfi at around 2:30pm and that took up most of the day. It was an amazing experience being able to snorkel and view the coast from the water. I highly suggest any top rated boat tour you see on “viator” and “get your guide” apps. The boat tour ended around 5pm and we got dinner in Amalfi before head in back to the airbnb. 

Day 8 (Positano): Thursday
We woke up at 6am and did the path of the gods hike to nocelle before going to pasitano. The hike was fun and was a great way to see the coast from up high. It was also nice to get active after drinking and eating throughout the whole trip. Pasitano is way better than Amalfi in my opinion. There is so much to see and do. We got there at 11am and decided to get a drink on the beach before shopping for pottery souvenirs for a few hours. Then we explored the town over called Praia no and went to the small beach they have there. It was a great way to unwind after a tiring day. 

Day 9 (Ravello, minori, atrani, praiano): Friday
We essentially did a town hop and tried to see as much of each town on the coast as we could. We started off in Ravello and it’s definitely the highlight of the Amalfi coast for me. We had pizza at piazza da nonno and it was the best pizza I have had in my life. Then we walked around the entire town to see the views, shop, and explore the gardens. Then we went to minori and walked around to get gelato. There was not so much to do here. Next we scootered to attain and swam at Conca dei Marini. Then we finished with dinner in Praiano and had great seafood for dinner. 

Day 10 (Travel to Rome): Saturday
We had an Italo train booked out of Salerno at 2pm so we left the coast of Amalfi at 1030am to give us plenty of time for error. I’m glad we did this because it took 3 hours to get to the train station due to traffic. Peter drove us again and was great the whole way dealing with the hectic traffic. We got on the train and used the metro in Rome to get to our airbnb in Prati to relax before our flight the next morning. The airbnb host was incredible and booked a taxi for us to leave at 7am the next day. 
Day 10 (Travel home): Sunday
 
Overall recap: Rome was beautiful but you can really hit the high notes in 3 days if you’re willing to get the steps in. Venice was incredibly expensive but also beautiful as well. I’m glad we did just one day there. The Amalfi coast in my mind has two ways to do it. You can get a hotel for 1k a night at some 5 star place and go full relax mode or do what we did and hop on a scooter to see everything you possibly can. We enjoy the later while we can in our young age. I hope this helps anyone who needs ideas on where to start planning their trip. September is the time to go! Weather was amazing and not too hot with smaller crowds than peak summer. Sorry for the long post and please let me know if you have any in depth questions! I’d be happy to answer and give guidance where I can. We will never forget this trip.

ItalyTravel,"Just got home from a 3 week trip to Italy with my Mom.  I'm just here to say that if you are planning on a trip with your parents or anyone that is aging, do it now before it is too late.  My Mom is 78 and she barely made it.  She looks amazing, goes to exercise class and walks but touring Italy was too much for her.  She was born in Italy and we also visited her family.  We did too much and I wish we could do it over again.  Just wanted to share my experience in case you are thinking of doing this.  Take it SLOW.  Don't visit too many places.

  
What we did:

  
Venice for 3 nights.  Took a private water taxi (thank God) that dropped us off right at the dock of our Airbnb.  The bridges were too much for her and so was the walking.  Let me know if you want a link to the amazing Airbnb we stayed at that was on the first floor with a glass floor over the water.  It was AMAZING.

  
5 nights with her family outside Bologna (her cousin drove us):  This was obviously the highlight of our trip.  It was still a struggle for her to do much walking at all.  She didn't sleep well, as the bed was really hard and our room was freezing.  We loved the tour of the Reggiano Parmesan cheese factory near Parma.  Being with her family was amazing and like I said, the highlight of the trip.

  
Train to Rome for 2 nights and then a guided bus tour to Tuscany.  Biggest regret.  We started out in Rome for a tour of the Vatican.  She barely made it back to the bus.  Then up to Tuscany for 8 nights where we toured Florence (total disaster - the poor lady sat in a restaurant while I hurried around and took some quick pics), Sienna, San Gimignano, Pisa and Vince.  We were supposed to go to Cinque Terre but she would not have been able to do it so we canceled that day.  We also missed out on a day long cooking class in the hills of Tuscany because she was just plum worn out.

  
She is the one who wanted to do all of this, and I am not upset at her.  Just thought I would share what happened so that you don't make the same mistake.  She has been to Italy several times but she was thinking that this would be her last time and wanted to see everything!  So I went along with it.  I spent over 10k just for myself and looking back, I am a little sad we had to spend so much time in our room as she slept.  I felt so bad for her because she was looking forward to this and we planned it a year ago.  I will say that it was still worth it just spending the 3 weeks with my Mom just the two of us (hubby stayed back).  But word to the wise:  Don't plan too much!  Pick a couple of towns and stick with that!  It takes days to explore one town and that won't even touch it.

ItalyTravel,"We arrived home to the US on Wednesday after an 8-day, 3-city Italy trip. I'd been to Italy several times but all more than 25 years ago, and my wife had never been. We're 54 and 60, respectively; reasonably able-bodied; I speak some Italian and she does not.

We decided to book our trip with the agency Firebird: they operate at all budget levels and will oversee as much or as little of the trip as is desired, from one tour to all the hotel transfers. We decided to visit Venice, Florence and Rome, flying direct to Venice and home from Rome, taking trains in between. Please note that this is just one person/couple's experience, and not meant to be absolute.

Venice felt to us a bit like Italy's Disneyland. Fewer and fewer people actually live there, and the archipelago's survival is now entirely based on tourism. The gondoliers often seemed bored and/or annoyed, and we found it hardest to find food we enjoyed here: everything is imported to the island and traditional Venetian food has a lot of preserved (i.e. pungent) fish flavors that were not enjoyable to our palates. The house wines - particularly proseccos or frizzantinos - were excellent. We took a private tour of Murano, Burano and Torcello with Rita Sartori of Alternative Venice that was the highlight of the trip, and seeing sunrise either from the Grand Canal by St. Mark's, or from the Accademia bridge is absolutely not to be missed. We found it to be a slowly-sinking city with a ton of history but no real present-day culture except for tourism.

We took the train to Florence and it was super easy, fast, and clean and dropped us off 5 minutes from the center of Florence. We kept our bags above us in the car, but people were leaving large suitcases in the storage between seating areas. I don't know if I would have - too easy for someone to steal at an in-between stop.

Florence was crowded and magical at the very same time. Every turn leads to a piazza with some beautiful statue or edifice, and just about any trattoria with a non-English menu resulted in outstanding food. Our best meal was at Trattoria dall'Oste, famous for their preparation of Florentine (Chianina) steak. I'm not a steak person, my wife is, and we were both utterly bowled over by the meat's tenderness and mild flavor. I even got a beef carpaccio at the recommendation of the waiter and nearly fell off my chair from delight: I can't imagine someone who loves sushi not being completely delighted by this dish. Pici is a slightly thicker spaghetti very popular in Florentine restaurants: it's chewy and holds up really well to spicy or rich sauces.  Vegetables are not often part of primi or secondi piattis - if a restaurant has any besides tomatoes, they're usually in the ""contorni"" part of the menu: often sauteed spinach or chicory, a side salad, or very plain grilled vegetables.  The Italian restaurant diet is very carb, meat and cheese heavy.

When the central leather market closes, a group of multi-ethnic musicians comes together and plays a variety of instruments for an ever-growing crowd, usually until about 10-11pm. They play Pachelbel's Canon, the 4 Seasons, and other mainstays, beautifully. It's a total joy.  The food market at San Lorenzo is bustling and fun, and caters both to local and tourist patrons.

We did not make it to the Altrarno section of Florence, which was my biggest regret: it's a lively, happening area, like the old city in Barcelona or Trastevere in Rome.  Many of the city's best restaurants are there, as well.

We did an all-day Chianti and olive oil tour with Walks of Italy that was quite good if the process of wine making (and lots of wine sampling) is of interest. 5 minutes out of Florence, the countryside looks like a computer screen saver: our pictures couldn't even do its beauty justice. On our next trip we'd like to spend more time in the Tuscany region and we were glad to see a snippet of it.

The train to Rome was only an hour and again, clean and easy. Rome is...massive. Rome is New York but with 2000-year-old ruins everywhere you look, and very heavy on the takeover of Catholicism. There are neighborhoods with completely different ""flavors,"" and we stayed in one of the mellower ones, not far from the Pantheon and Campo dei Fiori (and Rome's only cat rescue sanctuary), which we loved. One simply cannot ""do"" Rome in 3 days - it's sprawling and awe-inspiring and charming and real and overwhelming and overrrun with tourists, and so much else. We loved the Trastevere area and had our best meal there at Da Vittorio, but we could have had thousands more. Rome felt very safe for two white-European, middle-aged women.

The Trevi Fountain is dry and surrounded by clear plastic panels until December 2024, and police will tell you to get off the Spanish Steps if you try to sit. Try to go through sites like the Colosseum with a guide so you can get in the special, shorter lines for guided tours only, otherwise you'll be waiting a very long time.  Every site is under some kind of construction, being readied for next year's Jubilee.  If Rome was crowded now, it's going to be bursting at the seams in 2025.

Some overall thoughts: for us, three cities in eight days including travel was too much, especially since we wanted to see many of the more touristic sites in that time. If we could do it over, we'd give ourselves one more day in each place, partly so we weren't so grumpy and exhausted (see ""in our 50s""). We found people to be friendly for the most part and very receptive to speaking any Italian. Overall we felt very safe while there, we were rarely approached to buy anything (but we did see two people being lured into the bracelet ""game"") and it never felt aggressive. All in all, we loved being there, we found it difficult to eat well (or our version of well, which is more vegetable-heavy), we found it extremely walkable (+15k steps per day), and we missed green spaces as most of them are hidden behind private gates.

ItalyTravel,"We’ve been in Rome since yesterday. We got an airbnb in Testaccio and it was a few hundred euros cheaper than spots that were smack dab in the middle of Trastevere, despite Testaccio being within walking distance of Trastevere. 

This neighborhood is amazing. It’s quiet, safe, extremely peaceful, and I have seen very few other tourists. It’s a beautiful neighborhood with amazing food, gelato, pizza, bakeries, cafes, and bars, and you can easily roam around and find a place to eat where there will be more italians than tourists. 

I am biased with my advice here because I hate tourism (I just have a really hard time with crowds) but if you are the type of person who values travel where you can just experience what it feels like to really “be” in a place, then this is a really wonderful neighborhood to end up in. I have seen others post about being bummed about tourist groups taking over visits to landmark destinations etc. It is of course a delight to see wonderful historic destinations, but if you really want to enjoy yourself and experience things in the most “authentic” way possible, my greatest recommendation is to walk around with no specific goal in mind and roam in and out of cafes, shops, and eateries where the menu is *not* advertised in English, and most of the people eating there look or seem Italian.

ItalyTravel,"I think we all want to remember our trips. It's fun to think back to those moments where you were walking through the narrow streets or looking at something of breathtaking beauty. One of the best ways to remember is to take a picture since a picture can do more than just show you what you saw, but can actually transport you back within your mind to when those moments happened. I thought I'd share some advice I thought of when reflecting on my trip to Italy 2 years ago. 

Try to take more pictures of yourself or your travel companions than of just things. You'll be be able to remember the trip better that way. It's not that you can't take pictures of things but the pictures I have of only things, I don't actually remember 90% of those moments. Pictures I took that either have my wife or I in them (like standing next to a painting), I actually remember 90% of those moments. Something about the presence of yourself or people in a picture triggers your memory better. Also take pictures of all the restaurants you go to.

ItalyTravel,"The official ticketing website for the Colosseum, namely: [https://ticketing.colosseo.it/](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/), sells a very attractive bundle for an amazing price: it includes admissions to the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, the Colosseum *and* its arena, a guided tour to the underground levels, on top of entry to SUPER sites and any exhibitions in progress at the Colosseum and the archaeological areas. All of that for €24. There are other bundles on the website that cost the exact same price but include less admissions (the underground levels, for example, are unique to this bundle).

This website easily made its way to be my most hated website *ever* - it's buggy, it's confusing, and most importantly, it is **swarmed** with bots. All of those make buying tickets on the website, specifically and especially for the aforesaid bundle, nearly impossible. The time-difference between the release of tickets and them being sold out is *a fraction of a second*. Most of the time, you won't even be able to see any tickets available, let alone proceed with their purchase.

I have been studying the website for the last 2 weeks, trying to understand exactly how it works and how can I beat the annoying bots that purchase all the tickets the moment they're released. And I've finally done it - today I managed to buy 2 tickets (out of 3 that I actually need, pfft) on the website. You may be asking - ""why go through all this trouble?"" - because resale tickets can go *up to €130*, i.e., an increase of roughly 540% in price. Insane. And I guess this is why there are so many bots purchasing the tickets. If you want to avoid the expensive resale prices just like me, I'm going to try to teach you what you can do to beat this horrible website.

**1. When can I buy the tickets?**

If you want to get the tickets for the date D/M/Y at time X, you need to know that they become available exactly 30 days prior. You *might* think it means D/M-1/Y at time X - but actually no - it's exactly 30 days. Which means, the tickets for 05/09/2024, for example, become available at 06/08/2024 (this is due to August having 31 days).

\[By the way, this is the response I got from the website's customers service team asking when do tickets become available: ""To ensure equal distribution and access for all, we publish each date 30 days in advance (e.g. if you want to visit the Coliseum on 20 September, you can buy tickets from 20 August), you can still find tickets depending on availability."" This is **completely false** and misleading.\]

The specific time is according to Rome's timezone (GMT+2). Which means, if you want the tickets of 14:30 (Rome time), for example, you need to check what time it is going to be for you. For example, 08:30 AM in NYC.

**2. What's the link?**

I've managed to create a template for the link, which looks like this:

[https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena/?t=\[year\]-\[month\]-\[day\]T\[hour\]%3A\[minute\]%3A00Z](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena/?t=[year]-[month]-[day]T[hour]%3A[minute]%3A00Z)

• \[year\] is a 4-digit number of the year you're going to visit.  
• \[month\] and \[day\] are 2-digit numbers *each* of the date you're going to visit.  
• \[hour\] is the **2 hours before the hour of your desired reservation**. This is because the link is generated according to Greenwich's timezone (GMT+0) and not Rome's (GMT+2). This number is also 2 digits, according to the 24-hours format (so 5 PM is 17 and not 05).  
• \[minute\] is a 2-digit number of the minutes-part of the time of your desired reservation.

For example: the link for buying tickets on 05/09/2024 for 14:30 is this:

[https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena/?t=2024-09-05T12%3A30%3A00Z](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience-sotterranei-e-arena/?t=2024-09-05T12%3A30%3A00Z)

Notice how it's ""T12%3A30"" and not ""T14%3A30"" (conversion to Greenwich's timezone).

**3. What are the available time slots?**

08:45 AM, 09:00 AM, 09:45 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM, 11:30 AM  
13:00 PM, 13:15 PM, 14:30 PM, 15:45 PM, 16:00 PM, 16:45 PM, 17:15 PM

I recommend to have this website open, to see the exact time in Rome live:

[https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/italy/rome](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/italy/rome)

**4. What do I do at the moment of truth?**

Having the exact link in advance is crucial because it saves you many important seconds of clicking until you actually get to the safe zone. The link I constructed would allow you to skip clicking on the desired time-slot (when it unlocks). It automatically scrolls down to the section of choosing the price (most would probably want to choose the first option - which is full price). You're going to have to press the + button X times when X is the number of the guests.

Most of the time, you'll unfortunately going to see an error saying 'insufficient', which means - you weren't fast enough. But if you're lucky, after you pressed the + button, you might see the tickets under your cart, and a timer of 15 minutes would start running. **This means you got the tickets!** Congratulations. All you need to do now is find & insert your details & credit card number in 15 minutes. Which should be okay with the average WPM.

**5. What's actually going to happen?**

I tried this method at least 50 times the last 2 weeks and this is what happened to me 99% of the time: I go to the computer 1 minute before the time-slot opens. I have the link opened. The moment the clock hits the exact time, I start refreshing the page. Somewhere during the first 60 seconds of refreshing, I see the time-slot I wanted *for the first time*, but it's already sold out. Meaning I didn't even get to see the time-slot being available to purchase. I didn't even get to the ""+ button section"" which takes time itself. This is because the bots are super quick.

**6. What should I beware of?**

* The link needs to be open a few minutes in advance. This is because sometimes the website is loaded with people, and it's going to put you in a queue of \~5 minutes. Once the queue is over, the website becomes available for \~30 minutes or so (depending on your activity on it).
* If you refresh the website too quickly, it's going to ask you ""Are you a robot?"" with a simple box to tick. A fairly simple process (no captcha) but it takes time, and as you probably understand already, it's very crucial. I learned that to avoid this, you should take \~10 seconds between consecutive refreshes. You can also have more than one tab and then alternate refreshing between the different tabs.
* Sometimes (more often than you'd think) the website will be buggy at 'the moment of truth', and will show you a *different* time-slot being available for purchase at the exact time of another one. **This is a decoy!!** They're not actually available, and the moment you try to press the + button, you'll get the error of ""insufficient"", after which the *actual* time-slot will be free. And yes, you guessed correctly - it's going to be too late at that time anyway. What can we do.

Hopefully this is going to be helpful for some of y'all. And BTW, if anyone got a single ticket for Sep 05 at 14:30, hmu...",t2_euy1e1fsa,A Guide to Colosseum Full Experience Tickets,0.97,54,1722965039.0,1722965039.0,2,Pyrodraconic,1elnn6t
ItalyTravel,"It might be a weird question but it got stuck in my head. 🙃

I'm going to Italy the end of this week and while I'm searching for restaurants in towns or along our travel routes, I found most restaurants I want to go open at 7:30pm, everyday!! It left me wonder what time Italians go to bed and when they wake up for work? My understanding is ltalian meals go like this: appetizers, first course, second course and dessert, so that maybe an hour and a half? If people there finish their meals at 9, do they wait for a while or they go to sleep right away with their stomach full?

Frankly, I'm planning to wake up early to avoid other travelers and 7:30 dinner time is not going well with my plan. 😅 I know, I know every country has their own culture and I'm not complaining here. I'm just very curious about Italian routine!!

Edit: I think I found the answer and that is.. the bed time in Italy is like everywhere else. 😊 I think I was wondering if the bed time would be different from other places, let's say US but it seems like just the dinner times that are different. 

Edit 2: I live in US and most restaurants here, if not all, open by 5. Everyday, I finish my dinner around 6:30 at home or 7 when I eat out. To have dinner late (after 8 for me), it has to be a party or some kind of special occasions. So yes it was a surprise for me to find that no good Italian restaurants would be open before 7pm. I think it's cool that Italy has aperitivo and I'm excited to try it. I think it might just be my dinner for a couple nights. 😂",t2_d0rj0pbv4,What time Italians go to bed?,0.82,54,1714662756.0,1714662756.0,97,Cha_mizzou,1cii521

ItalyTravel,"The evening of 10/21/24 while traveling alone in Riomaggiore, I found myself in a very dangerous situation with a local business owner stalking, threatening, and sexually harassing me. Thankfully a tourist couple stepped in to help me while other business owners refused to, and I give full credit to Fran and her husband for giving me the opportunity to get back to my room safely. I'm not able to share more specific details here due to privacy rules.

ItalyTravel,"We have had a incredibly wonderful trip around Italy for a month… until we arrived to the Amalfi coast.

First we got to Salerno from Rome, bought ferry tickets to Amalfi, so far so good. But then we had to move by bus to the minor town we’re staying and we had to face the extraordinarily terrible bus service.

We have been essentially trapped in one area. Buses are full, super late or super early, don’t stop (it’s like we’re invisible), are not frequent enough and don’t run after 9:30pm, tickets are sold by folks literally on the side of the road in Amalfi. Unmarked “taxis” see you on the bus stops for hours and offer you a ride for ridiculous prices. 

Outside of hiring an expensive private driver or water taxi (renting a car is definitely out of the question), how do people manage to avoid SITA buses where ferries don’t reach? Even booking tours is a challenge because meeting points are in the major cities like Amalfi or Positano or Sorrento. 

We are very positive and loving the area we are in, but we would like to move around and we can’t. It isn’t even as packed as we feared.

ItalyTravel,"I didn't see a post which outlines the new website's process, but have seen quite a few questions and lots on confusion posted recently, so hopefully this post helps some out that are trying to get Colosseum tickets. These are based on my recent experience with the new website [ticketing.colosseo.it](http://ticketing.colosseo.it)

1. The website above is the only official seller. All others are reselling (actually pre-selling) tickets at a mark-up. Co-op Culture no longer sells the official tickets.
2. Tickets for the entire day you want all go on sale at 08:45 Central European Time (02:45 EST, if you care) \[EDIT: Tickets go on sale **30 days** in advance at 08:45 CET\]. Open the website on a few different browsers beforehand (2-3 browsers: this will be important later). During high volume, the webpage will place you into a queue that last 2-5 minutes before you can get onto the website. Do not refresh this queue.
3. Select the tour you want and you should be looking at a calendar. This is where you're waiting for your day to open up. If your vice is a stiff drink, have one available for the remainder of this process.

**\*\*\*Warning: this website is absolutely terrible.** My best guess is that the servers are grossly underpowered for the volume but I'm no IT nerd. From this point forward, you'll be faced with complete frustration. Be persistent!

4. Once 08:45 CET rolls around, with beverage in hand, start refreshing your browsers. You'll likely get kicked out of the site (that's ONE of the reasons why we opened a few different browsers). Keep refreshing until your date changes from ""Not available online"" to a clickable link.

5. Once you click the date, you'll see ""Choose the Time of the Visit"" where you select the tour time and number of tickets.

6. Here's where it gets really fun: you'll select the number of tickets and see ""INSUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY FOR THE SELECTED TIME"", and think to yourself ""There already sold out!?!?!?!"" Nope. Remember when I said that the website is terrible? Keep refreshing this page. and again... again...yep, again. Sometimes you'll get kicked back to the queue screen to start all over (again, multiple browsers) Do this for about 50 minutes (in my case) until it finally works and you have tickets held for you. You'll know this because the ""Select Participants"" button will turn from gray to red, and you can click to advance.

7. Now you're on the page with a timer where you'll enter contact info. This webpage will also have an error message again... and again... yep again. Keep it up. You're doing great! The timer will stress you out as you spend another 10-15 minutes trying to get this page to work. At this point I was slurring belligerent expletives at my computer, but luckily the family was fast asleep.

8. You haven't smashed your computer yet and now you're at the payment screen. This one is super easy... just kidding, it's still terrible. My advice: use a credit card. The website didn't like my bank (debit) card. Also my bank didn't like the website, because they froze my account due to the suspicious nature of my purchase attempts. That was fun to find out the next day while trying to pay for gas.

9. Pay for the tix and boom, one hour later and hopefully your persistence paid off.

**Now for my question: I selected 2x full price and 2x free children tickets, but my final purchase only show 2x full price tickets which makes me very nervous. Does anyone know if this is normal or will I need to leave our kids at the gate?**

**TL:DR... be persistent. The website is garbage and you'll think they are sold out, but they aren't. This process took me 1 hour at 2:45 - 3:45 in the morning.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone! I'm making this write up here as I struggled to find information on traveling the Amalfi coast on a budget (not necessarily shoestring, but still keeping costs low).

Trip duration: 4 days (1 being a travel day) in the last week of March over Easter. We flew in and out of Naples airport.

Amalfi Town: We stayed in Amalfi in a pretty Airbnb just 5 mins by walk from the duomo for around 35euros per person per night. Great location, a big house with a kitchen and balcony 10/10 recommend!

Amalfi Town is beautiful, and the food was so good. We had dinner from Pizzeria Donna Stella under lemon trees at night (around 14-17 euros per dish). If you ever go here, try the lemon ravioli (I found it recommended here on Reddit and 10/10). We took a short walk during sunset to Atrani and the view during the blue light hour was unreal.

In Amalfi we did a lemon tour, and it was a great experience to find out why lemons are so abundant along the coast (PS: it came with a tasting which was so good). We also visited a paper museum and got to make our own sheet of paper!

Positano: We took the bus from Amalfi Town to Boomerano (around 2.8 euros) to hike the Path of the Gods and see the famous View of Positano. If you suffer from motion sickness consider eating medicines before boarding. The hike was stunning, and the view of the pastel houses on the cliff in Positano was unreal. The was a little cafe at the end of the hike where we had lemon and orange granita and it was so refreshing! The hike was slightly hard towards the end where we had to clamber over rocks, and then go down 1700 steps to reach Positano town.

I'm very glad we did this, because Positano was absolutely swamped with people. The restaurants were terribly pricy (for us, we were trying to stick to a budget), food didn't taste great and we had selfie sticks shoved into our faces everywhere. It was pretty, but looked nicer from the hike viewpoint. The line for the bus stretched all the way down the road due to a ferry cancellation, and also were less frequent due to the Easter holidays. We finally got one back to Amalfi and caught the sunset on the way (it was so beautiful).

Ravello: Next day we took a bus to Ravello (2.4 euros) and visited the beautiful villa there. The town was charming and the lack of crowds (morning) made it very pleasant. Entrance fee to the villa was around 17euros (reduced price in off -season). The scenery was stunning and if you don't want to do a hike to Positano, I would suggest visiting Ravello to see the view. We came back to Amalfi Town for a late lunch and to wander around (the lemon sorbet was excellent).

Vietri-sul-Marne: The last day we took an early bus to Vietri and this town absolutely blew us away with it's beauty (dare I say it looked nicer than Positano?). There were stunning ceramics everywhere in the city in the most unexpected places. We had a great time just wandering around admiring the colorful town. Do go up to the train station (there were no trains due to some maintenance issue), the view from there is so pretty with the small red roofed houses and the stunning blue water.

Final thoughts: Amalfi coast is stunning and definitely can be seen on a reasonable budget. We had a boat tour booked (100 eur pp, the cheapest we could find & with only 12 people in total), but the sea was too rough. We took a ferry from Salerno and got a good view of the coast that way and it was beautiful, would definitely come back.

If you're someone who suffers from motion sickness, take pills because the roads are very narrow and sea was quite rough in March.

The best tip I have is to get up early (we were out of our Airbnb by 7-8am everyday) and we had most places empty and all to ourselves (except surprisingly the hike). The views are worth it, and it's much nicer when you don't have 100 people all jostling for the same photo. We took it easy in the afternoon when it started getting very crowded and then by evening it quietened down again.

I'll be very happy to answer any questions or share any other stuff (like restaurants) if anyone is interested!.

Finally, if anyone is wondering why I haven't covered anything about Naples, I just didn't like it that much. It looked like the city was frozen in time (not in a good way) & we loved the natural beauty of the coast much more:)

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone! Love this sub and it's a great wealth of info. I wanted to try to start something on this sub by asking a few questions related to a specific topic, and having everyone who has traveled to Italy (or lives there) answer with their opinion. I've done this on another sub in the past and it worked out really well, and in the end we wound up with a gigantic thread of people talking about and discussing the topic, which in this case was ski passes in Northeastern US.

Anyway, the first topic I wanted to try is **Food in Italy**, which vastly varies from region to region. **This thread is not meant to debate what type of Italian food is the best, but rather talk about your personal favorite so people reading can learn about the wonderful variety of Italian food.** Here are the questions, which I'll bold so you can easily quote it in your response.

**What is your favorite Italian region (or city) for food?**

**Why?**

**Any specific restaurants or places you want to mention in this specific region/city?**


My answers to start:

**What is your favorite Italian region (or city) for food?**

Salerno (and surrounding Campania) 

**Why?**

Everything was just so wonderful. Seafood, bufula mozzarella, pizza. We had our best Italian meals in this area. 25 euro for linguine and lobster pasta, crazy. My favorite meal (i forget its name) was pasta (linguine I think) with octopus, calamari, clams and mussels. The pizzas we had were definitely the best pizzas we've ever had. Hell, the sandwich we got from the grocery store in Positano with the local meat and cheese was one of the best meals of the trip, or maybe we were just really hungry after Path of the Gods? 

The drinks were no slouch either. We discovered Falanghina, a wonderful white wine that goes amazingly well with seafood and bufula mozzarella. I think we ordered it we every dinner and hunted it down when we returned to the US, sharing it with our friends and family. I'm not a red wine fan, but the main campanian red wines made from aglianico grapes are delicious as well.  Everyone has heard about limoncello, but what about meloncello? It's delicious!

ItalyTravel,"I'm now back from 3 weeks in Italy, and the biggest take away was that all the fearful things I've read in this sub wasn't a factor for me, at all. Maybe I read too much into it, but I've never felt safer in any of these cities. No pickpockets, no stalkers, no harassments, no rude people, nothing. I was more pestered by hungry pigeons than people. The places I went were safe and I felt fine the entire time. Now, I am 6'2"" and look Italian, so maybe that helped. But I saw nothing of the sort in terms of crime.

**Rome** was amazing. I've never walked so much in my life. Of course the food was 10/10.  Wife and I spent 5 days there and I could have probably done with 3-4. We did the night tour, Vatican, and ate everywhere we wanted to eat. I even got to visit Profondo Rosso - a movie shop ran by Dario Argento and Luigi Cozzi. I got to meet him, he signed a bunch of posters and DVDs of movies that he wrote and helped Argento on - it was a dream come true. 

**Florence** I instantly fell in love with this city. The sights, how close everything was, the food, the shops, it was all amazing. I wish we would have landed in Florence, I liked it more than Rome - where Rome felt like NYC this felt more intimate and special. Went to the Uffizi and Academia galleries - the most amazing art I've seen that I'll never forget.   Also, a TON of leather shops, it was funny how many side by side leather shops there were. I must have walked passed at least 50.

**Cinque Terre** was amazing. A LOT of stairs, I'm still sore, but the sights and views were second to none. We did the boat tour with Jennifer on her Pink Hyena (she was amazing go see her for a boat our) so we saw all 5 villages and visited 2.  This was a piece of heaven. Everyone should see this place at least once. We stayed at Rio Maggiore.

**Pisa,** every time I told someone here I was going to Pisa for 2 days, they told me not to. I don't know why, this was a fantastic place. The leaning tower, of course, but the restaurants were amazing, people were great, and it was the best Air BnB we stayed at for accommodations. Very walkable. Such a quaint little town. 

**Bologna** my wife and I love food, and this was our Mecca. I'm obsessed with mortadella and prosciutto so this place was built for me. I'll never eat better than when I was here. Everything was walkable. Bought all my cheese and olive oil here to bring back. Loved it.

Overall, felt super safe. Wallet on the tables when I ate, phone in my pocket with no worries, everyone was SUPER nice, maybe the bruise to a few of these visits were panhandlers but they were not pushy at all.  Now, I am Italian (living in Canada) and speak the language so this was a big help, but even so, everyone seemed to speak some English and were always super nice.  I even walked Through a protest with no worries. I talked to the state police and they were super nice - it was all such a friendly place.  I stayed out late and walked down dark alleys at times, where the worst thing I saw were drunk teens having fun.  Now, I never took a bus or was at the metro / train station at night, and if those areas are more prone to crime, that might make sense, but it wasn't the case for me.

I knew the drivers were on another level, but I forgot how crazy and good the drivers all were. Never saw an accident, never saw scratches or dents on car doors or bumpers. 

I feel 3 weeks was too long for me, though. I could have had the same amazing experience with just 2-3 days in each city and just doing 2-3 cities. 3 weeks I was getting sick of pizza and pasta every day (and that sounds crazy even to me).  When everything is amazing, it all kind of blends together. But, still worth it of course, I'm sure home sickness is normal. I can't wait to go back - so glad I went in late Oct / early Nov because the heat would have killed me. I even wish I would have went  a bit later for it to be a bit cooler. I could never do it in the summer.  
Bummer that Rome was under construction, I didn't get to see the trevi fountain but it didn't bother me much. Glad I got this trip in before 2025. I have such an appreciate for the history, food, and people there.

One realization I had nearing the end of my trip was: Italy seems like a place that will slow you down, in every good way possible. The stairs, the sights, the restaurant service, the people, it's all meant to slow you down, live in the moment, and not rush to the next thing. Where in my routine at home, I'm eating something quick, making a quick bite, eating while watching TV, driving everywhere and not walking, rushing to get work done, and so on.  But in Italy, as you walk you notice the sights, you chat up the local people, you take it all in at a nice pace. I realized this at the end of my trip, but definitely appreciated every minute of being there.

ItalyTravel,"I just returned late last night from a trip to Italy and I figured I would report my experience seeing as this sub helped me quite a bit in planning this trip. My trip itinerary was:

First night it rome (walk to the colloseum and fountain).
Left for Venice the next afternoon. 
Stayed in Venice for 3 nights.
Traveled to Bologna for a cooking class, 
Spent 4 nights in Florence.
Took a day trip to Luca because Florence wasn't our vibe.
Traveled to Sorrento for 5 night.
Day trips to Capri Island and Amalfi Coast.
Headed back to Rome for a night before flying back.

I used my credit card for most purchases but some required cash. I spent about 1000 cash and the trip (not all required)

Venice was the highlight of our trip by far. Tons of little fun shops. Murano island and their beautiful glass blowing was fantastic.  The food was good Roso Pomodoro was a really good restaurant. There was this little town square near one of the museums that had 3 restaurants and each restaurant had a live band with fun cocktails. I would sit and enjoy a drink while listening to the live music which was really good. The streets of Venice were busy but not overly so. The gondola ride was nice but the price advertised is for a half hour tour, if you want longer it costs more and it is a cash transaction. 

My only real complaint about the city would be traveling over the bridges with bags. Our train out of the city was early so we weren't able to take the water taxi to the station and had to walk most the length if the island early in the morning to grt to our train with all our luggage. If you buy fragile items in Venice, some shops will ship them home for you for a price (and then pay the tax once it shows up in your country).

From there we took a day in Bologna. That city seemed really nice and I wish I had spent more time there. Lots of live bands and some interesting war memorials in the streets. As far as car traffic goes it was probably one if the more tame cities. We took a cooking class in Bologna to learn fresh pasta making before heading the Florence. Thankfully train stations in Italy have a service to hold your bags for a day if you have a day trip.

Unfortunately things went a little down hill from here. My train from Bologna to Florence was supposed to bring me a couple of blocks from my hotel. The train got rerouted do to some police incident and we ended up 2 miles away. We ended up walking that distance in the hot Florence heat. The hotel address wasn't 100% on Google maps and we ended up having to call the hotel for directions. 

Florence was very hot, very busy, and filled with unsavory street merchants with over priced products. The sidewalks were barely big enough for 1 person in many areas and the car and scooter traffic around there seems dangerous. That being said there was some things I enjoyed about the city. The architecture was pretty. There  is this little Cafe that sits right across from the second, outside, David statue that serves amazing hot chocolate and pastries. I ate there most mornings as I found it pleasant.

The bridge that had a ton of little jewelry shops in it was cute. I really enjoyed the Galalaow museum. There is this huge private park on the opposite side if the river from the Galalaow museum. It is right next to a large fort. The parks is absolutely breathe taking and nice to walk. 

We got a little bored with Florence and decided to take a day trip to Luca. That was a pleasant small village with some nice small shops and restaurants. A fun park that runs along an ancient wall. 

On our way to Sorrento we ran into problems with the train again. There was a strike at the train station so our train was canceled. Luckily even if there is a strike, trains between major cities still run. We were able to hop a train to Napoli and there was a commuter train that run from Napoli to Sorrento from there. 

Sorrento and the surrounding region was nice. Pompeii was something we could get to on the before mentioned commuter train. 

We took a bus to Amalfi Coast but the bus broke down so what should have been a 90 minute bus ride turning into 150 minutes with multiple bus changes. 

We took a small chartered boat tour to Capri Island but the island was so busy that we ended up hiking up the mountain to the main business district.

Swimming in the region was a bit inconvenient as the beaches in the area were beyond crowded. Some were actually stone beaches... 

At one point we tried going a lemoncello plant but Google maps messed up again and we ended up getting lost on a mountain hike. 

Heading back to Rome we ran into troubles again with the train. I didn't realize there were 2 stations in Napoli and I accidently booked the wrong one. I had to talk to the people at the station about changing my ticket even though the train in question passed through bith stations. It was a slight inconvenience. 

Though we did end up catching the archeological museum in Naples which was pretty cool. 

Our last hotel in Rome was a bit of a pain. They seemed most like an air BNB that just rented out rooms of an apartment complex than a legit hotel and the hotel.com site referenced a free shuttle to the airport but apparently it wasn't free. But at that point we had basically run out of Euros so we had to tell them that it had to be a card only taxi. They assured me that was fine but when the taxi arrived the next morning they wanted cash only, i ended up giving them every last euro and American dollar I had for them to agree to take me to the airport. 

For the food overall it was good. But Italians pride themselves on simple cooking with their great (x20) grandma's recipe and I'm pretty sure they all share that same great (x20) grandma because aside from the level of cook on the individual dishes. Most of them tastes the same. It isn't like the states where you csn eat at 10 different restaurants, order the same dish, and the food will be incredibly different between the two. There are only so many ways you can good eggs, flour, rice, cream, cheese, tomatoes, vegetables, and ground proteins and get something unique. I'm a little tired of italian food for a bit. 

Also, I was surprised at how little italian sausage was used in most dishes. I was expecting a lot of cured meats on the menus but most of that was just ham. 

TLDR: All in all it was a good trip but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Venice was everything I had hoped for and more. But the big cities of Rome and Florence are so congested with pedestrian and car traffic that it feels unsafe. 

The train system was a bit frustrating. 

The beaches in the coastal region just a bit too busy. 

The food was good but everyone cooks things so similar to each other it was difficult to differentiate between restaurants. 

Be wary of what Google maps tells you.

Both my friend and I got sick during our trip with a few days in between and different symptoms.
We used Doctors in Italy and received great service. My friend went to their office while we were in Rome and I used the virtual appointment when we were in Tuscany. My doctor was very kind and we have been writing daily as my situation is up-and-down.

The instructions from our driver to exit the station and turn right at the pharmacy just weren’t making sense because the pharmacy was INSIDE the station just BEFORE the exit. With the help of local police - it became apparent that we were at a different station. 

So just letting others know to be aware of that. 

Had a fabulous time, we weren’t the victims of any pickpockets (although we did find someone’s wallet and turned it in to authorities), and no one tried to sell me a bracelet in the streets of Rome. In fact I didn’t even see anyone doing that anywhere we went. 

I only saw two homeless (or houseless if you prefer to phrase it that way) and no one living in a tent.  The crowds in Florence were overwhelming. Not so bad in Rome and limited to Saint Marks and the city center in Venice. Weather was lovely in the low to mid 70’s (F) and I would not want to be there when it was hot.

ItalyTravel,"First off, I want to say thank you to this community as I used a lot of tips/advice from these threads before my trip that helped out a lot. It was my wife's (30F) and I (29M) first time in Italy and in Europe in general and we had the best vacation ever!

Overall: Italy is a beautiful country with amazing people, food, and sightseeing. I see why people go every year. My favorite was Venice! I can't wait to plan my next trip to Italy and visit new cities!!

* Flights
   * KLM: LAX -> AMS -> VCE - 20K points + $87.20 each
   * Iberia: FCO -> MAD -> LAX - 40K points + $160.50 each
   * Because of these layovers I got stamped in AMS and stamped out in MAD, no Italy stamp on my passport :( lol
* AirBnB
   * It is normal for hosts to request pictures of your passports as they need to register you.
   * For Venice, make sure you have cash for the city tax. We just had to leave it in the AirBnb when we were checking out. It was €4 per person per night. 
   * We did 4 nights in Venice, 2 nights in Florence and 4 nights in Rome. Total for all AirBnb's - $1,750
* Transportation
   * Airport to Venice, we took Alilaguna. We bought the tickets when we landed at a machine for €14 each. All tickets are the same but just pay attention to the different color sections as they all have different stops. We used the Orange line as it stopped in Sant Angelo
   * I used google maps in all the cities and it had pretty accurate times for all transportation. Do plan to get to the stops a few min early if you can because sometimes the busses are early. 
   * Getting around Venice we bought the 72 hour pass once we got there at one of the kiosk stations. This same ticket will take you to the Murano and Burano island.
   * Getting around Rome, we did not buy a pass we just used our CC's when getting on the bus. Make sure you have 1 CC per person for these busses. You cannot buy 2 tickets with 1 CC if you are buying on the bus. 
   * Validation: you read it everywhere on these threads but we still saw people in Venice and Rome getting tickets for not validating their tickets. For trains, make sure to validate before getting on the train. For water busses in Venice, validate before getting on. For busses in Rome, you validate while on the bus, there is a little yellow machine that stamps your ticket.
   * I bought my train tickets in advance to get from Venice to Florence to Rome via Italia Rail with no issues. Since these tickets were digital, I did not need to validate them at all. I tried booking through Trenitalia but was not able to. For Pisa, we just bought the tickets at the train station from one of the kiosks, those we did have to validate before getting on.  
   * Rome to Airport. We had a 6am flight and at that time there is no public transportation to get you to the airport. We pre-booked a taxi the night before using the FreeNow app and had no issues; the guy showed up at 3:15am exact. 
* Food Quality & Walking
   * The food and the quality is amazing in Italy; we were eating pasta, pizza, gelato, pastries, and drinking alcohol every single day and you would think that eating this every day you would get tired of it but nope! Idk how to explain it but the tomatoes are so good.
   * Also came back 3 lbs lighter; if I were to eat the same here in America I would be 3 lbs heavier and feel like sh\*t. 
   * Even when taking transportation we were still putting in 15-20k steps every day. 
   * We only made 1 dinner reservation and that was in Florence, Osteria Pastella. My wife wanted to try the truffle pasta that they make in the cheese wheel; did not disappoint! 
* Tours 
   * Colosseum & Vatican City - I tried getting the tickets through the official sites with no luck so I went through Viator. I have been reading about them canceling but we got lucky and the tours were great. For colosseum we bought the guided tour with arena access and for the Vatican we got the guided tour. Both tour guides were amazing.
   * Although we bought on Viator the actual company for the Colosseum tour was through Crown tours and the Vatican tour was through City Wonders
   * Skip the line - again for this I had read that you don't skip the line, you just skip the line for buying the tickets. For both the Colosseum and the Vatican there were separate entrances for us; we waited no more than 5 mins and got in very quick both times. 
* Cards/Cash
   * I took €300 and didn't really need that much for 10 days. There was only 1 restaurant that did not accept card so had the cash ready. The other time I needed cash was for the Venice City Tax. Near the end of my trip I just started using the cash to get rid of it but still had leftover. 
   * If you do take cash, order ahead of time from your Bank so that way you already have it when you land and you get a better conversion rate. 
   * I took 3 CC's just in case; 1 Amex and 2 Visa's. Make sure you take CC's that do not have foreign transaction fees.  
* Phone
   * We have T-Mobile Magenta Max so both me and my wife had 5GB each and we did not come close to reaching the limit in those 10 days
   * We also used WhatsApp to communicate with our AirBnB hosts
* Souvenirs
   * We traveled with 1 carry on and 1 backpack each. We took an empty duffle bag in my backpack knowing we would want to bring things back. 
   * We brought back: 6 bottles of wine, 4 bottles of limoncello, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cheese, multiple snacks, magnets, pistacchio cream and espresso cups.
   * I would recommend to buy these things at a grocery store instead of the souvenir shops as it is more affordable.
   * In case you weren't able to get anything, at FCO after you get through security they sell a lot of these things, yes even at 4:30am! I ended up buying another bottle of limenccelo at the airport and carrying it in my backpack. 
   * We used these protective bags for all the liquids - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004FLK2IU?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004FLK2IU?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
* Speaking Italian
   * Try to learn basic sayings depending on how much time you have until your trip. You don't need to know much tbh as many people speak English but they will appreciate you trying. I did Duolingo for 3 months and was able to ask basic questions and order un caffe e un cornetto 
* Crowds
   * If you have been to Disneyland in the summer, Disney is a lot worse because it is packed all over the park! I am not sure if we got lucky but reading all the prior posts I thought I would be shoulder to shoulder everywhere I go. That was not the case at all.
   * Obviously the main spots are going to have large crowds but if you walk just 5 min away you will be fine.
   * In Venice and Rome we woke up early to go take pictures at the famous monuments with little to no crowds. 
* Scams
   * 10 days in Italy and I did not get pick pocketed?! What happened?! Again reading prior posts I thought it was bound to happen. Jokes aside, just be aware of your surroundings and don't let people get too close to you. People are not going to snatch your phone right out of your hands. 
   * If you are really worried about getting pickpocketed just wear a cross body bag that has your important items (passport, cash, cards, phone, etc..) 
* Most surprising to me
   * Pistachio!! I have a new love for pistachio! The corenneto's, the gelato, the spread, the pastries, the snacks, and even the McDonalds pistachio McFlurry! Amazing!!

Didn't think I was going to write this much so I apologize in advance if any of this is not helpful. Again wanted to thank this community as it made my trip that much better.

ItalyTravel,"I was on a month-long trip to Europe with Italy being the last destination where we spent 10 days. 6 days in Verona and then 4 days in Peschiera Del Garda. And, oh my god! I was blown away by how amazing this part of the country is. I chose these cities because I wanted fewer crowds and a more relaxed holiday. Verona is an absolute gem and so underrated. The entire city is straight out of a medieval dream. We did some Osteria-hopping and city exploring with a day trip to Venice. It was very convenient to get around on foot, with buses and trains of course. Venice was awesome too but I wish it was less commercial and touristy. Lake Garda is a more wiser choice than Lake Como. It is bigger and there's more to do. Food was ""chef's kiss"".  
Misadventure: We were supposed to fly out from Milan so we decided to book a hotel around the Malpensa airport. That meant we had to take a train from Peschiera Del Garda to Milan and then another from Milan to Malpensa. 15 minutes into the second train journey we realized we had tickets for the next train and decided to get off at a station to avoid being fined. In all of this, we left our ""the most important"" luggage on the train. It had our laptops, cameras, iPad - everything. I still feel anxious remembering this episode. We searched for it on two trains that were coming back from the airport and just when we were about to go to the police station, the third train arrived. We decided to try our luck one last time and guess what - the same train manager walked out and asked us to follow her to the first train car. The driver asked me a few questions and then he pulled a bag, which was ""THE"" bag. My heart almost stopped when I realized that a bag with all of the devices traveled on an Italian train for 2 hours and got back to us as if nothing had happened. People were so helpful. They stopped to hear our problem and offered solutions. One of them called the police station and asked for help.

ItalyTravel,"I wrote this during our trip and posted on the final night before our trip home. I felt I owed it to this subreddit because I got many tips from here prior to the trip that were useful.

Locations and landmarks visited:
Florence, Cinque Terre, Sorrento, Almalfi Coast, Positano, Rivello, Rome

8 day trip (not including some unremarkable travel days), backpacked, walked mostly, airBnBs exclusively, train commutes between locations (mostly)

Some bullet points beneath each day but I try to summarize here.

- These locations were very hilly. One comment about Italy is how hilly/steep these locations were. Be prepared or don’t plan to walk as much as we did.
- Trains were a great way to commute between locations. We had zero need to rent a car. Use Trenitalia app, using some alternative is really not worth even discussing, no comparison.
We packed things in and did a lot everyday, spent a decent amount of time on trains. This fit our style and budget (and patience), but this may not be your preference and that’s ok. This was a box checking kind of trip.
- Avoid the big cities if you don’t like crowds, business, loudness, etc. 
- Get some euros, many places take cards but just get some euros, you’ll be glad you did. (Taxis, vendors, cheap stuff here and there)
- It was hot and never rained. Pack accordingly.
- This subreddit fear mongers about tourist traps and pickpocketing and whatnot a lot. I had no issue with any of these things. Every restaurant has menus outside and a host trying to escort you in. Doesn’t mean the restaurant is bad.. keep your wits about you and you’ll be fine. Being confident in your choices and your planning is way better than being fearful of mistakes or scams.

Day 1 - Arrival & Commute Rome to Florence 

Train from Rome Airport to Roma Terminale and then SMN in Florence. 20 min walk across town to airBnB. Several flights of stairs to airBnB. Walked around Florence. Lunch at random restaurant (no wait, dozens of similar options). Mercato Centrale for dinner, very affordable, tasty, good experience. Gelato at Vivoli (nothing to write home about)

-  pack light, be fit if walking with pack. Anticipate stairs
- Don’t stress about finding a quick bite to eat, options everywhere, never had a wait
- Use TrenItalia app, Omio was not ideal for changing train times (glitchy). After a day or two you will become expert at the trains
- Mercato Centrale was a tourist trap (I guess), but it was still very worthwhile. Vendors selling cheap souvenirs were outside but not pushy or anything (they are all over the city doing this, not an issue)
- Knowing some Italian would’ve been nice to feel more comfortable/confident but was not an issue anywhere. Almost everyone spoke Italian the entire trip

Day 2 - Florence to Cinque Terre day trip

Early morning to Cinque Terre. Train to La Spezia and then to Monterosso. About 3.5 hours of trains. (1st train was 7:30am, if you can, I suggest going earlier, Florence was fun to see on the early walk to SMN). Took hike b/w Monterroso and Vernazza. This was amazing but people aren’t lying when they say it’s difficult and I consider myself in great shape. It was about 2 miles of stairs up/down and uneven surfaces. I loved it, my wife who doesn’t do well with heights/anxiety did not enjoy as much. Start of trail is not near train station, at first we went up a different trail which was very steep for no reason (lead us to a cemetery). The trail starts on the side of Monterroso closest to vernazza, once we got to the center of Monterroso you could see the trail starting very clearly up a big ramped sidewalk. Cost around $27 euro each for trail access and unlimited trains b/w 5 towns. Regrettably this was the only hike we did, rest was by train. So I can’t comment on other sections of the trail.

Vernazza was the most beautiful/picturesque town by far. We had an expensive but enjoyable lunch at a restaurant overlooking its small bay after the hike. Got lucky finding a table right away I think. Would have been an awesome place for a swim if we had our suits.

Corniglia was probably my favorite. It was small and there is approx. 383 stairs to get to it from the train station but it had great views/ice cream. Aside from the aforementioned hike this had the best views. I enjoyed a large cold beer on a bench overlooking the sea/valley. Not as much shopping here but a few markets.

Cannot comment on Monarola as we did not stop there.

Riomaggiore was nice, pretty basic had a Main Street (kind of steep uphill) with lots of shops. Very basic but nice. Didn’t spend a ton of time here.

Overall spent about 6 hours in cinque Terre. Probably not enough to see everything but we felt it was enough to see some spectacular views, and pause for a bit to take in each location which is really what we wanted. 

Had a late dinner at Cucina Torcicoda in Florence. Would recommend, has a pizzaria and a restaurant side. Pizzaria is casual, restaurant is fancy.

- don’t attempt hikes if your not into heights/excersize. Get a water bottle for the hike. Wear comfy shoes and pack light
- Skip Corniglia if you cannot do a lot of stairs.
TrenItalia app useful for changing ticket times for long journey, dealing with delays, etc

Day 3 - Florence (Palazzo Pitti, Boboli 

Gardens, Ponte Vechio, Piazzale Michelangelo)
We didn’t want to stand in lines at places like Uffzi and Academia and thought Palazzo Pitti and Boboli Gardens would be a good alternative. It was a good chance to see the other side of the river too and Ponte Vechio is on the way. You can buy tickets for both of these attractions right from their website (Cumulativo Pitti - Boboli)

Palazzo Pitti was full of artworks/sculptures from 1500-1700 era and also some more modern things. It was large with many stairs, difficult after the Cinque Terre day but worthwhile. I enjoy the history on the Medici family which helped. The palace was very large which in itself was fun to imagine what it was like back then.

Boboli gardens were very nice but truthfully just long paths through a large area (still enjoyable don’t get me wrong, just lots of walking). There are significant uphill climbs in this area if you want to see it all. One spot in particular, Palazzina del Cavaliere (gentleman’s pavilion) offered great views of the Tuscan countryside and city skyline. We exited near Porto Romana and there was a fruit merchant there so we enjoyed some fresh fruit on a bench and saw a piece of the Oltrarno district. This area was a bit more chill than downtown Florence so it was nice. 

We stopped for food at La Botteghina which was directly across from the main entrance of Palazzo Pitti for lunch. The Porchetta sandwhich was by far the best food I had since being in Italy (at this point in the trip at least) It has a restaurant and then a little panini shop, this was purchased in the panini shop).

Ponte Vechio was ok, most of this area was exclusively jewelry shops, especially on the bridge itself. 

Dinner was at Ristorante Oltrarno. I chose because it was on the river as well it was close to Piazzale Michelangelo, but it’s right against a busy road which was loud. We were also downwind of some trash cans so the smell often wafted towards us during dinner (something to consider). I probably would skip this restaurant as the food (although good), did not make up for the loudness and smells.

The river was a fun spot to see. Has a nice sidewalk to walk along it.

After dinner we tried to see the sunset over the city from Piazzale Michelangelo. It’s true the view from here is spectacular, you can see the entirety of Florence. However it was very crowded with like minded tourists. So if you really want to have a good spot and stay for awhile I suggest going early. We arrived right at sunset, perhaps 30 minutes earlier would suffice. We could still get pictures and see the view though. It has a nice park around it though, pleasant walk.

- wear comfortable shoes
- Get to Piazzale Michelangelo well before sunset
- Oltrarno district was slightly more quiet and a very nice part of Florence

Day 4 - Train from Florence to Sorrento

Long day of traveling with train delays. Circumvesuvania within Naples station had a lot of signage to get there, but once you see the ticket booth/entrance we glanced over and walked right past it. If you go down steps to an open air plaza with shops then you’ve gone too far. The circumvesuvania train was pretty packed with limited seating, tough for long day of travel with pack but overall manageable. Air BnB we booked was way up at the top of the town. It had great views and luckily we could handle the climb, but it was a massive hill to get back sometimes several times a day. Keep this in mind if booking up there.

Had time to walk around to see a marina, the sawmill near the town square and stuff. Dinner at Molo ‘52 was very good, right on the water and great service. Offers great views of the architecture built into the cliffs along the coast as well as Mt. Vesuvius and the impressive yachts in the marina.

- give yourself some time in Naples Centrale to find the Circumvesuvania station. It runs often and tickets must be bought on-site. It’s beneath the main station, take stairs in center of station and follow signage.
- Sorrento is not flat, if not staying in the main square be prepared for climbs

Day 5 - Bus Tour of Almalfi, Positano, & Rivello (Mondo Guides w/ Viator)

This was a rewarding experience. Positano was beautiful, lots of shops leading down to the coast. There was a small public beach where you could dip your feet if you wanted. The shops were largely lemon themed, some more expensive than others, with the budget touristy shops intermingled. There was a nice church near the coast which is right along the path so worth stopping at briefly.

Almalfi coast was similar to Positano. It had a much larger beach, there was a smaller beach  to the west and en route to this beach there are some more peaceful benches to relax at away from crowds.

We had lunch at Luisa here, a panini. It was decent and peaceful. It didn’t compare to the sandwhich I had in Florence near Palazzo Pitti but nevertheless I would recommend for something quick.

Rivello was amazing. It is situated high on the mountain with incredible views. The main town square was very well kept and included these views. The ‘infinity garden’ (villa cimbrone) was a bit of a hike but not bad. It had amazing views of the coast (not for those who are afraid of heights, or avoid the ledge). It was very quiet and tasteful, popular spot for weddings I believe. Rivello is also home to several cats. There were the ruins of Villa Ruffalo right by the town center which looked interesting but we didn’t have time to visit.

The ride home took us through the spectacular mountains surrounding Naples.

We ended the day with dinner at Bistro Sorrento. I highly recommend as the food was incredible. It is up on top of the town, so plan for a hike or take a taxi. They have a car to take you home after dinner if desired.

- The ride to these towns was intense. The driver was very skilled but it’s not something I would attempt on my own. Many hairpin turns and tight squeezes over cliff side or with several tourists on the road. Avoid if you are very queasy. 
- The shopping in these towns is very similar to Sorrento so don’t think that you need to buy something.
- If I could do it over again I would consider taking a ferry to all these towns, but that wouldn’t get me to Ravello which was my favorite (personal preference)
- Bring a bathing suit if you know you’ll have the time! My wife and I wished we had been able to take a dip to cool off and experience it.

Day 6 - Exploring Sorrento

We wanted to visit Bagni Regina Giovanni but decided it was too far (although buses do stop near there if you want to research it). Instead we went to the public beach near marina grande. It was a bit of a hike but worthwhile as it was very quiet, free, and worthwhile. A couple cool sites to see on the way too. 

The main shopping is on roads to the east and west of the main town square. There are several side streets full of shops. This was all your basic touristy stuff, the only local and unique places we found were the inlaid woodworking shops. We bought two wooden watches from GS Gargiulo Inlay. This was clearly a generational shop with many offerings. 

We had lunch at Mari right by the town square, fantastic diavolo pizza, quick service, would recommend.

Dinner was at Bienvenuti in Casa. It’s highly rated on trip advisor but I would skip it. They bring out limencello shots after dinner with their TripAdvisor QR code so it’s no surprise. But the food was nothing special in comparison to other places we’d been. Good service though and relatively peaceful.

- consider Marina Grande for less populated beach. Go early or it will get busy. Sand was scorching and sticky, recommend sandals, there is a shower nearby to rinse off. Bring sunscreen. You can pay for chairs and umbrella here if desired. 

Day 7 - Train from Sorrento to Rome, Exploring Rome

We took the Circumvesuvania to Naples and then a train to Rome. If you get to the train station in Sorrento early enough you can get a seat, we arrived ~20 minutes early. The Naples station has food options and a bathroom for 1€.

For the first time we didn’t hike with our packs to the airBnB as it was a 40 minute trek in 90° heat. The taxi line(s) at Roma Termini was long but efficient. We ended up in a taxi with no meter, no card reader, no receipt. We paid €48 for our ride to via Pelegrino (~20 minutes) but I felt I was scammed. In the taxi line you take whatever taxi shows up when it’s your turn (I suppose), other taxis looked better and more professional but we were tired and I didn’t feel like arguing. 

We had time to shower and walk to the Colosseum. We didn’t have tickets but we saw the Palazzo Venezia, Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palantino and Circus Maximus from the outside. Surely it would’ve been better with tickets but still rewarding. There were several people selling waters outside and some vantage points from the sidewalk. This was the mid afternoon and very crowded but the lines looked manageable. 

We walked back along the River Tiber which was nice to see, great views and history. We viewed from Ponte Fabricio which is the oldest bridge in Rome (62 BC) and that took us to Isola Tiberina, which wasn’t remarkable in itself but a nice place to sit. 

We found a basic restaurant in Campo de Fiori for a cheap meal. This was recommended by our host but ultimately had only a small market (flowers mostly), still a nice place to sit.

- If possible, look for a nicer taxi which has a meter and POS machine. I would walk if you’re staying close to Roma Termini.
- Bring water, but also know you can buy them cheaper everywhere and refill bottles in several spots all over the city

Day 8 - Exploring Rome (Vatican Museums, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza del Popolo, Villa Borghese, Piazza Navona)

Morning hike to the Vatican Museums. En route we saw massive lines to enter St. Peter’s square (this was at 8am), the museum entrance is on the backside of the city. It was relatively obvious which line was for ticket holders vs. those who needed to buy. The no ticket line was large all morning, not sure why they wouldn’t just buy tickets online unless maybe they were sold out??

The museum was great, the largest I’d ever seen. Massive amounts of famous art and sculpture everywhere. There is a cafe here to eat breakfast. Sistine chapel was nice as you’d expect, they enforce the no photos (they just yell at you) but they don’t enforce the dress code that I saw (not many breaking it though). The museum didn’t grant access to St. Peter’s square or the basilica that I could tell. I wish I had seen those though, but another line and another ticket…

The remaining landmarks seen we simply walked past but didn’t enter if it required a ticket. So I don’t have a significant amount of info. But the trevi fountain was fun, very busy. The pantheon was nice to see, probably would’ve benefited from going inside though. Piazza del popolo and piazza navona were underwhelming honestly, just plazas with sculptures, lots of people selling junk and whatnot.

The Spanish Steps were honestly just steps with a decent fountain and okay views, more people selling junk. I’d say if it’s convenient then pass by it but don’t go out of your way if you have other priorities.

Villa Borghese was a nice park and very large. We rented motorized bicycles (it was more of a cart which sat 2) for €12 an hour which helped since we had been walking all day. It’s free to enter and a good place to just kill time and see various things. We didn’t enter the gallery here but I wish we had. Good views of the skyline from here as well. 

We tried to go to Emma Pizzeria for dinner but had a long wait. It looked popular so I recommend making a reservation and trying it. Ended up at Elysian next door which was unremarkable.

- more tourist trap restaurants than not in Rome that we saw at least. Make time to hunt out the good ones and make reservations before your trip. (The tourist traps still were tasty and not disappointing though).
- There are taxi stands all around if you don’t want to do as much walking as we did.
- Be prepared for crowds and hot weather. 
- Water vendors everywhere and fountains to refill.

Day 9 - Travel Home

ItalyTravel,"I just came back from a 2 week trip to Italy and did some shopping during that time. I wanted to report on the VAT refund experience in case there is anyone out there with the same concerns I had.

While shopping in Italy, the stores prepared our tax refund paperwork for us. The stores we shopped at used Global Blue or Planet Tax Free. Our Global Blue forms were completely filled out by the stores for us, including passport and credit card information for credit card refund. Our Planet forms did not include our credit card information already filled in - I had to write out the information on the paperwork myself prior to arriving to the airport.

We had a flight from FCO back to the US through Terminal 1, flight scheduled to depart at 9am. We arrived to Terminal 1 around 7am. At FCO (at least in Terminal 1), if your tax-free items are being sent in checked luggage, you can use the VAT counter which is located BEFORE security in the departures hall. 

If your tax-free items are in carry-on luggage (like us), you need to go through security and passport control first. We tried to get it done before security, however there are multiple signs posted that you have to go through security first if you are bringing your items on your carry-on.

Once you pass security and passport control, there are 2 different VAT counters - one near Gates A and Gates E (near E11). Initially we went to the Gate A counter and the customs officer redirected us to the Gate E counter since our flight was departing from the E gates. There are different lines for kiosks/counters depending on which refund company you need (Global Blue, Planet Free, etc). There is also a Customs counter. 

We went to the customs desk first thinking that we needed to get a customs stamp and have our goods examined (as is the case in other European countries), but learned that goods purchased in Italy are electronically stamped (I'm assuming via scanning your Tax Refund paperwork at a kiosk) and you do not actually need to see a Customs agent unless specifically prompted through the kiosk.

So we lined up for the Global Blue kiosk first. There was an employee from Global Blue helping each person, taking your paperwork and scanning it on the kiosk for you. (You can also do it yourself if there is no employee around). The kiosk will prompt you to scan your boarding pass and then confirm with you that the amount to be refunded is correct and on the correct payment method (for us, our credit card number appeared). Afterwards the kiosk will print out a receipt, and that's it. No need to mail your forms or put anything in a box (like other European countries).

We then lined up for Planet Tax Free - this was not a kiosk but an actual counter with a person. I handed her my paperwork with my boarding pass, she confirmed that the credit card number I filled in was correct, and then printed out a receipt for me. No need to mail any forms.

Overall once we figured out the right area to go to, the whole VAT refund process took less than 10 minutes. I received the Global Blue refund back on my credit card in about 3-4 days. Still waiting for my Planet refund (it's been a little less than a week since we arrived back).

Hope all this information helps!",t2_vzyv86di,VAT refund experience from FCO Terminal 1,0.98,48,1715387551.0,1715387551.0,15,snowduckie1,1cp4rg4

Day 3: I was sick so unfortunately we didn’t do much and I had to get a dr’s appointment to get some antibiotics. I recommend Mobi doctor if you need an English speaking doctor in Italy! Just $30 and super quick and easy telehealth visit. We went to Klass for dinner and it was good. San Crispino for gelato… FANTASTIC YOU MUST GO!!! 

Day 4: Vatican tour this day and shopping. Lunch at il panino ingegnoso sooo good we went twice it was delish. Don’t remember where we got dinner but it was mid so… We also went back to San crispino because it was that good. 

FLORENCE

Day 5: travel to Florence, went to central market for lunch, dinner at lo scudo DELISH!!! 

Day 6: academia gallery, food tour for lunch, and dinner at acqua al 2 (get the balsamic steak and thank me later) 

Day 7: shopping and relaxing because I still wasn’t feeling the best, dinner at Da Pinocchio… SO GOOD 

Day 8: ufizzi gallery and pitti palace, dinner at Osteria de Peccatori. 

Day 9: Medici chapel, vineyard tour, dinner at da Pinocchio again because it was just THAT GOOD. 

VENICE 

Day 10: travel to Venice, dinner at 1000 gourmet

Day 12: we did a professional photoshoot for memories and shopping and 1000 gourmet again because it was so good 

Day 13: murano and Burano islands and 1000 gourmet (don’t judge Venetian food was suspect) 

Day 14: just walked around Venice, relaxed, dinner at home

Day 15: traveled back home 

Tips: 

-don’t wait in long lines for food at really popular places… there is so much good food in Italy and you will find some really good places if you trust your instinct

Rome: 

-Roma termini is a very long walk and the BOTTOM is for the metro. Top is for other trains to airport and other cities. Do not be like me and think you have enough time to walk there all up hill with lots of luggage and almost miss your train by one minute and have to sprint through the train station. Also just go ahead and pay for the ticket you can change if needed because it is worth it for flexibility. 

-taxi system isn’t great, free now works sometimes but isn’t super reliable for people to pick up your ride. Download itTaxi also because there are a ton of those taxis in Rome. 

Florence: 

-do not miss the Medici chapel it is amazing but pre-book so you can see the secret room!!! 

-trying to do uffizi, pitti palace, and the gardens in one day may kill you. I was so dead after the gallery and palace that we barely walked into the gardens before I looked at the huge hill and said NAH we getting a spritz

-the inside of the Brunelleschi cathedral is underwhelming compared to the outside so if the line is long do not feel like you MUST go inside. It is free entry tho so up to you but I would rather do Medici chapel 

-top floor of central market is very touristy… skip it and stay downstairs. Get a lampredotto sandwich if you are up for it. 

Venice: 

-you can do all of st mark’s square in one day but get skip the line tickets so you are not waiting in line. We had zero wait the entire time for all attractions. 

-Bell tower is a MUST as it is all by lift and the views are amazing 

-murano is cool but definitely make sure you do the glass exhibition versus the museum because that would have been cooler in my opinion. 

-burano was so cuteeeee and we had a great time walking around and looking at the colorful houses

-be warned that Venetian food is not like American seafood. It was suspect to me but you might love it! 

-if you go to 1000 gourmet (which you should) make sure you get spicy oil for your pizza and try the chips with fondue and sausage… so good. 

-if you can swing it… set up a photoshoot in Venice with a gondola ride because at the end of the day the gondola rides are expensive and you may as well  pay for a photoshoot to have nice pictures as well (especially if you are traveling as a couple) ",t2_mm3d2a1i9,Feed back from our 2 week trip in Italia! ,0.92,45,1713996916.0,1713996916.0,41,Bee-Girl-1997,1ccbb9i

ItalyTravel,"Ciao!

I wanted to contribute to the sub by reporting in on our recent trip.

First, I may be biased but this trip was extremely wonderful as I became engaged 😍

We stayed 3 days in Milano and 4 days in Cinque Terre. In Milano we stayed a 5 min walking distance from the central station. While yes, there was lots of activity and *some* shady folks, I never thought that I was in danger. We still used common sense when navigating the city as travelers.

Side note....The BEST FREAKING meal we had in Milano was at La Betolla di Piero. I'm ruined forever when it comes to not being able to have Risotto like that anytime soon lol.

In Cinque Terre, we stayed in Monterosso and ventured out to other towns during the day. We hiked from Manarola into Corneglia (OMG that was tough!) on one day then hiked Monterosso into Vernazza the next (not as bad). 

We ate at Ristorante La Torre in Vernazza. Excellent place, excellent views and once again, I'll be ruined because where can you eat a pesto pasta dish like this outside of Italy.

Pro tip, if you hiked any of these, be prepared with shoes and water. A big THANKS to the lesbian couple that saved me and my fiancé's life with the Biosteel you gave us!!

All in all I love Italy and have seriously been thinking about moving internationally with this being an option. I felt safe as a person of color who happens to be LGBT+.

It will be our first time to Europe and I am looking for suggestions on how to plan my trip to Italy. Your help is very much appreciated! 

Here is the places of interest:
- Land in Rome in the morning
- Rome to Florence
- Florence to Bologna
- Bologna to Rome
- Spend 4 days in Rome before flying back

I have about 6 days for Florence and Bologna - How should I split up the days? 

For Florence, Bologna and Rome: What are some activities or attractions I can visit (probably not too much museums, places with free entry fee is better, food will be good)? How about accommodation - somewhere affordable and convenient access to places? Some tips on travel to and from these places will be useful.

I tried to talk to Trenitalia employees, but they told me that I probably will never retrieve it.  
Thankfully, there were no documents inside it. I did lose my very nice NorthFace winter jacket, which I think I will not buy again lol

ItalyTravel,"My wife and I, both 45 years-old brazilians living in QC-Canada, travelled to Italy last october. And I can't say in words how much we loved it! We've been around and I consider ourselves experienced travellers, but still we were amazed by the beauty, the culture and the culinary of the country! 

How can things taste so much better in Italy? One can eat and drink so well and still not spend too much. I sewear my wife used to hate Aperol Spritz, butI convinced her to try it on our first day in Rome and, ever since, she wanted to order more every time we seated to have lunch or dinner or just to rest a little bit. She also loved Limoncello Spritz, we brought two bottles home. Not once we felt anything less than welcome in every single city we went. Never felt unsafe either.

We rented a car to go from Rome to Pienza, Florence, Pisa, Barolo, Turin, Milan and Maranello. We drove quite a lot and spend a lot of time on the road, but we like to drive around the countries we visit, so we enjoyed it. Specially Tuscany and Piemonte. I know many people fell in love with Tuscany and I can understand why, but to me the Piemonte is the one I fell for! We like wine and Barolo is my preferred in the world, so much we bought an extra luggage just to be able to bring some bottles with us. Being from Brazil I can't say anything bad about the Italians careless driving style, it felt just like home! The only thing that stressed me was the infamous ZTL's, I think I managed to avoid then all, but time will tell.

We took a train to visit Naples in a day trip from Rome. Somehow we managed to almost lost our train in the morning even though it was one hour late and we were in the station the hole time! Tourists sometimes are just clueless. Anyhow the experience made us better for the next times. We also took a train to go from Milan to Venice, this time it was a breeze.

It's true what people say here, do not rush things while in Italy. Take your time to appreciate things. I regret not having more time in Naples and Turin and I had to completely miss Sienna just because we didn't had enough time. Today I would plan the trip differently, giving more time to things. If you want to visit a place, stay there for at least two nights! I'll take that lesson to life.

I did learned a bit of italian before our trip, ti was a bit easier for me as what is not similar to french is similar to portuguese.  While it was nice to better understanding things, I found that most people speak english and in Piemonte it was easy to find people who speaks french as well. I only had two or three occasions where it was useful, but nevertheless it was appreciated for everyone, everywhere. So, give it a chance before your trip!

Always take your passports with you, we were asked ours at least three times. One when we were just getting out of a toll. The police officer was very polite after I asked him in my broken italian if he spoke english or french. Also, if you're from anywhere else than Europe Union, you must have an international driving license with you, even if the car rental company doesn't ask you for.

I would like to say thanks to everyone who posted tips and suggestions here in the last three or four months. I read I lot of posts and even though I made some mistakes I'm sure I had a better trip because of all your advices! And sorry for the long post ;-)

ItalyTravel,"Back home from my trip to Sicily l want to warn you of a possible new way to scam you into ""buying"" the add on insurance packages when renting a car.

Although I never had problems with renting a car so far I was prepared that the insurance issue might happen and lo and behold when I come to pick up the car the employee starts trying to sell me the insurance package for almost 300€.

I told her no, I already opted for full coverage when booking via a German broker site. I didnt expect how much insisting on that I dont want the insurance package would be required. I really had to stand my ground until she accepted her lost cause with me. So I thought.

Now here comes the trick:
The signing of the contract was to be done via a tablet.
She handed me the tablet, telling me to sign the contract ""here"" with a pop up window where to sign already activated and in the foreground so it was blocking the view on the actual contract.

From a sudden impulse I decided to click x on the pop up to see the actual contract.
Of course you should always do that but imagine travelling solo with your luggage and half a dozen people impatiently waiting for you to get it done so they can get their car too. 

The pop up window was clearly a set up because although I declined she nonetheless put the insurance package into the contract and wanted to scam me into signing it.  They already had my credit card info from paying the deposit beforehand so I would have been billed and having to prove I didn't consent to buying the insurance package.

Also, the contract was all in Italian, which is ridiculous that they do not offer at least an English version.

She played it off as a mistake, yeah, sure Jan...

So be careful guys what you are about to sign no matter how many people in the line are getting impatient.

ItalyTravel,"I got some lovely feedback on my trip report about Venice, so thought I'd continue with some random thoughts on Florence, particularly how my experience of it compared to my time in Venice. Am interested in other people's responses!

1. Took the train from Venice St Lucia to Firenze Maria Novella and it was a dream. My big tip here would be to get the Trenitalia app - it's very handy to use it for tickets (seats are reserved) and showed the platform for the train long before it appeared on the departure board. The train arrived well before it departed, so I was able to board, stow my luggage and get settled well before anyone else entered the carriage. The free onboard WiFi was very fast and there were charging points at the seats (though they didn't work for me, alas). 

2. Getting out of the train station in Florence was a huge shock to the system for one reason: traffic. I had become totally accustomed to life with no cars, trains or bicycles in Venice, and I felt deflated to realise I would have to navigate these obstacles again. While Florence isn't congested at all, medieval streets and modern modes of transport don't mix well - the pavements are typically very narrow, often only allowing people to move in single file. There were many instances where I had to go into the road to make room for people passing the other way, which was often stressful given the cars and motorbikes whizzing past. Of course I knew this would be the case in the abstract, but it hit me surprisingly hard in reality.

3. Don't do what I did and wheel your suitcase to your accomodation unless it's very close to your point of arrival in the city. I honestly found it harder to move through Florence with a suitcase than I did in Venice, and the pavements were often pitted and poorly maintained.

4. Florence is very, very beautiful but I found it harder to love than Venice. This was for two main reasons: traffic, and the greater difficulty of escaping the crowds. In Venice, I could easily slip down an alley and be on my own alongside a peaceful canal when the crowds got too much. In many areas of Florence, this was much harder - even if you can get away from people, you can never completely escape the cars or bikes. It's a much more 'normal' city in this way, with locals clearly shopping and eating in areas that are also frequented by tourists (in Venice, there was much greater separation between the two). 

5. I ate very well in Florence - had delicious pastries, stuffed pasta and pizza. No complaints here at all!

6. Whereas Venice itself was the main attraction of that city for me, and I found pretty much every new area of the city totally enchanting, my real highlight of Florence was a paid for experience: the Ufizzi Gallery. It was spectacular and I passed four hours there in wonder, amazed by the quality and beauty of the work on display. While the ticket price might seem high, it's excellent value for money if you have any interest in art whatsoever. A truly world class museum. The other paid for experience I did was the Medici Chapel, which was pretty much only one very, very spectacular room - I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless you're particularly interested in Medici lore, as 9 euros was a bit much for what it was. 

7. The other hit of Florence for me was the Giunti Odeon, which is a spectacular cinema/bookshop. The ground floor is given over to bookcases, whereas the balcony remains filled with seating for evening showings. The best thing is that the balcony is free access when the bookshop is open, and it was full but peaceful - full of students working on essays and sketching. It was a wonderful place to just go and rest and relax, no strings attached. The cinema seats might be the comfiest I've ever experienced, and I liked that they were showing some eccentric animated shorts during my visit.

8. I didn't see a single public drinking fountain in my time in Florence, which might be due to my having less time to explore (2 nights in Florence vs 4 in Venice). It was a shame though as it made it more of a trial to stay hydrated. 

Overall, I admire Florence and think it's very beautiful with a fascinating and unique history. But I didn't have the same feeling of falling in love with it as a place, like I did with Venice.

I've got Rome in store next, which I'm very excited for! Am hoping I'll be more acclimated to traffic by the time I arrive in Roma Termini.",t2_n89u4,Trip report: Two days in Florence (October 2024),0.98,43,1729708054.0,1729708054.0,23,Nonsuch42,1gahqbe

* 4 days in Vieste with a day trip to Monte Sant'Angelo
* 2 days in Gaeta/Formia visiting family

We have been to Italy countless times and this was our first time to Ostia Antica. I think you can get there via train but we had a rental car and there was free parking. It was INCREDIBLE! Entry was 18 euros I believe. I could have spent all day there if it wasn't so hot out. If you're not going to Pompeii, this is worth the day trip.

ItalyTravel,"Just spent about a week in each Rome and Florence in early June. Overall I loved it! Wonderful art and so much history and beauty everywhere. Loved the Vatican Museum,  Uffizi Gallery, and Borghese Gallery especially, just the art that I saw there completely made my trip! Was blown away by Michelangelo, Botticelli, Bernini. Also liked the little peeks into ancient/modern juxtapositions, like lighting and sound checks at a church in Assisi for a concert later that evening. Loved the nasoni water fountains everywhere in Rome.

Some of my favorite moments were simply pausing or lingering somewhere--having lunch at a market and people watching, reading in the gardens before visiting the Borghese Gallery, having an espresso after meals, sitting under a tree at Boboli Gardens, wandering around the streets of Rome at 6 am due to still being in another time zone for the first few days or so. :)

I thought the food was fantastic, especially once I started checking reviews and making reservations. I jumped between several apps in order to figure out where to eat -- Forked, Find Me Gluten Free, and Happy Cow (for vegetarians/vegans). Portions were perfect, flavors lovely. Really enjoyed the espresso and gelato of course. Gluten free pasta and bread in Italy seems way better quality than in the US. I also ate groceries for 2 out of 3 meals. Picked up some fruit and veg at a farmer's market and was pleasantly surprised at the affordability of fresh produce, and how pretty it was.

It was my first solo trip, and I did a ton of research beforehand on Reddit, so thank you all for your posts, inquiries, and recommendations! I have a terrible sense of direction (thankfully Google Maps exists), but am aware of my surroundings (Italy felt safer than the U.S. cities that I'm used to), and carried a bright yellow backpack (any important stuff was in a zip bag on my front) that never got mysteriously opened (although I met another tourist who was pickpocketed). I pretty much relied on walking everywhere, with a few taxi rides for arrival and departure.

Also, I found the way I dressed seemed to influence whether people spoke to me first in English (casual, not matching that well), Italian (dressy, slightly sharper), or ask if I'm Japanese (neat but slightly oversized).

ItalyTravel,"I offer this just as a PSA for other unsuspecting/ignorant visitors... on our first day in Rome a few weeks ago my wife and I were looking to get a taxi from Roma Termini to our hotel, which was 3 km away. Apparently, we had gone out the back or side of the station rather than the front, where the official taxi queue is, so I ended up hailing a taxi the old-fashioned way. This was an official taxi with TAXI on the roof and a metal plated taxi permit in the car as well. I first noticed that he offered to take our large backpacks and put them in the trunk (we didn't have large luggage), even though we could have easily held them in our seats. I then noticed while we were driving that the meter wasn't running. I asked him while we were driving (probably the wrong question), ""how much"", and he said it would be 38 euros- 32 for the trip, and 3 for each piece of ""luggage."" And cash only, no card. If we didn't have the cash, he said he would take us to an atm on the way (like we're hostages). Thankfully, we had the cash. I was very hot and tired and didn't feel like messing with this guy any further, so we just ate the loss. Lesson learned, find the taxi stand. 

This was our only bad taxi/transportation experience in Rome and Naples. We used Freenow a couple times in Rome, which was always reliable. And in Naples, our hotel had negotiated flat rates to various places like the airport, the ferry port, the lungomare, and the train station. We also used the underground metro in both cities, and the metro line 1 in Naples is especially useful.

ItalyTravel,"Ciao everyone, I am from the UK and just got back from Veneto/South Tyrol after getting married & honeymooning there.

Damn, South Tyrol is breathtakingly beautiful. The number of times we were blown away by the scenery/food was ridiculous. Whilst I was driving my partner had to keep reminding me to close my mouth because my jaw was literally agape in awe. 

We got to our first stay and after a bit of trial and error realised that German and Italian were both equally valid choices to use. Admittedly my Italian is very basic but I can get by with German. So we were ok trying to use either as much as possible, which the locals seemed to appreciate as when I reached a linguistic stumbling block they would happily offer up a smile and a response in English. I enjoyed trying though and learning new words & phrases.

Our stay was blissfully peaceful for the first days, despite having to do driving in Italy for the first time in a car that couldn't do hills. I got the hang of it and would occasionally pull over to let traffic pass on the more mountainous stretches as this car would struggle to get out of 1st gear on inclines (stressful, but it became a fun personal challenge eventually). We got married in the Dolomites, 2 years of planning seemingly went out the window as the weather was forecast as Thunderstorms and Thundershowers for the full first week. Panic ensued. We ordered white umbrellas off amazon in panic, but we're in the mountains it's not gonna be next day delivery. More panic as weather becomes like something from an apocalyptic movie, buckets of rain, hailstones etc. Blind panic now as my wife was terrified her delicate, white dress would be destroyed and we'd be like drowned rats. The day of our wedding the storm gods smiled on us and despite the forecast the sky's parted and we had beautiful sunshine for 6 hrs! The wedding and photos took 5hrs 55mins. You literally couldn't have scripted it better. The day, ceremony and my wife were all beautiful and the experience and setting will stay vividly with me forever.

This peace was shattered upon arriving in Ortisei where we were seemingly surrounded by American tourists. I'd say 90% of them seemed to shout every thought they had, refused to speak anything but English and got angry when someone didn't immediately understand them. After this point in the journey we eventually went on to Venice and whilst crazy busy you could still hear the American tourists over the crowd, it was wild. I was led to believe the ""Loud and Obnoxious"" stereotype when it comes to American tourists was just that, a stereotype. Did we get unlucky with a bunch of bad eggs? Or is this actually pretty common? Before anyone says it, I am aware that every country has ""Bad"" tourists, hell just look at places like Ibiza and Magaluf and you see the worst the UK has to offer. However our experience in Italy was that everytime a serene and picturesque setting was being enjoyed by locals/tourists a new group showed up shouting their conversations at one another, they would be American. I really got irritated by it and especially the rudeness to staff/other tourists and topped with no 'per favore', 'grazie' or even the English variations, riled me up. So is this commonplace? Asking both other tourists and Italians.

Back to honeymoon, which we did our final chapter in Venice. While Venice has a lot of charm and is very beautiful, it is so overcrowded with tourists it can make getting from A to B very stressful and Chaotic. We managed to stay off the beaten track mostly and found some real gems, especially when it came to restaurants/cafes and again I loved practicing my Italian and am eternally grateful to the people I spoke to for having the patience to listen to me try and correcting me where needed. These moments where we found somewhere a little quieter were rare but allowed us to really see how beautiful it is. However for the most part it feels a bit like disneyland italy, just jammed with too many tourists into a space too small for the numbers.

Despite the amount of moaning I've done, apologies, it was the wedding/honeymoon of my dreams, my dreams couldn't even have topped how amazing it was actually. We have actually decided to both spend the next year really getting stuck in to learning Italian so that we can potentially emigrate and start a family. 

If anyone wants tips on routes through the Dolomites or restaurants etc just let me know and I can add my driving itinerary etc to this post, it may help, it may not but the offer is there.

ItalyTravel,"My husband and I just got back from almost 3 weeks in Italy. It was my first time to Europe and first time using trains for transportation. (From the US). We each only brought a backback with about a weeks worth of clothes.  So we did laundry once a week. This worked out great!  The only things I pre-booked were our accommodations and our transportation between cities. We aren’t really into tours. The idea of being herded around like cattle with a large group of people didn’t interest us. Plus we didn’t want to set up too much of a schedule. Our goal was to experience the culture and just explore and relax as needed. 
We flew into Rome and spent two nights there. Wasn’t planning much other than getting oriented and over the jet lag. We ended up walking around quite a bit and fell in love with the city!  It’s like a lived in, live museum. 
We then went to Positano for 3 nights. Wow. Stunning. Amazing. We just walked around and explored the shops, hiking trails and town. We loved the little beach off to the side of the main beach as there were few people there and it was gorgeous. 
Then we took the ferry to Capri and spent 3 nights there. Same plan, walk around, explore, hike, try all the food. So incredibly beautiful. 
My biggest anxiety was getting us from Capri to Cinque terre next. This involved: walking to the little train thing that takes you to the ferry, taking the ferry to Naples, getting a taxi to the train station, then three train exchanges, then walking to our hotel. I was concerned something would go wrong and we would get stuck or miss a connection. But the trains were so efficient. Straightforward and easy to navigate that everything went perfectly smooth. 
We stayed in Riomaggiore for 5 nights and explored each village, the hiking trails, as well as some time in Levanto. We would have loved to rent bikes there and do the famous trail, but the rental place was closed from 1-4pm so we didn’t get a chance. Cinque Terre is stunning and amazing. We loved it so much. 
Next we took a train to Venice and stayed 4 nights. WOW. We were worried about it since we have heard a lot of negativity, but we loved every second of it. We just walked around and explored everywhere, especially away from the crowds during the day. It is stunning. We enjoyed finding the many campos in town, having an aperol spritz and people watching.
Every place we went was so unique and beautiful.  We loved every second and cannot wait to go back. We were very happy we packed light and didn’t schedule anything specific. It was all perfect.

ItalyTravel,"I’ve read in all posts and sites that, Italy you don’t require much cash and about 400-500 euros should be more than enough for 2 weeks.

We are day 1 in Rome and almost every shop we went into asked for cash. I feigned ignorance as the day went by because I wanted to leave cash for hotel house keeping or other things that are truly cash only. 

Once I said I don’t have cash, they’ll reluctantly pull out a machine and seemed unhappy. I get it with really small purchases like a bottle of water or a couple of coffees for a few euros, but even when buying a bottle of wine at the end of the night…the clerk asked the same thing. 

Genuinely curious if there a specific etiquette about this I should be aware of and should follow? In Canada we just tap our credit cards for the smallest things so was used to that…

My husband and I decided to do Italy for our ten year anniversary and after neither of us actually nailing down specifics I just picked dates and started looking at flights. We planned our childcare with my parents last night so I booked the flights this morning!

We land in the morning on June 30 in Rome and the plan is to spend 3/4 days there and then go down to Naples for 3/4 days before flying out of Rome on July 7. We don't have our heart really set on anything specific. I'm really looking forward to just walking around and enjoying the atmosphere (and eating!). My husband is excited about architecture but as we've always lived in small town USA I think he'll be happy just walking around looking at everything.  In Rome we want to do the Forum and Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and the Sistine Chapel. In Naples we want to do a day on the beach/water and a day in Pompei and possibly a jaunt to Reggio di Caserta.

I’ve been traveling for a while and I’m kind of burnt out on big cities. Because Italy is so popular with Americans now I feel like most places have been overrun by them. I know that I am also a tourist, but I really am looking to have a more Italian experience that I’ve been able to find in the cities. I want to get a sense for what life is like in an Italian area, the culture,  music, the language, etc. I really want to be able to assimilate to daily life. I’d like to spend at least 14 days somewhere so choosing somewhere that has good day trips would be great. 

I love nature like the Dolomites and beautiful views/old cities like Sirmione. Hiking, swimming, renting a boat, exploring sounds great.

I’ve had a few recs for Sicily but it’s hard for me to to tell how “Italian” it is there (for example, I would say Alta Badia is not very Italian) and if it’s overrun with tourists as well. 

I’m a woman traveling alone in my 30’s and would like to be somewhere I can meet people my age if possible. I’m not a partier but I like to meet people at cafes and aperitivo. 

I’m not opposed to heading North again if the best option is up there. I haven’t seen anything in the South though so I’ll probably prioritize that even though it’s hot as hell right now.

I would really appreciate any thoughts and suggestions for where I should go!",t2_6bzx6ano,"Where should I go next that has beautiful nature, isn’t overrun my tourism, and is somewhere I could spend a couple weeks?",0.86,43,1725521920.0,1725521920.0,80,acarna23,1f9gr66
ItalyTravel,"I stayed in a 4 start hotel with continental breakfast each morning and a salt water pool in Maiori. The staff was amazing and treated me like a queen and it only cost $500 a night and I stayed for 4 days. After traveling to Amalfi using the ferry which was affordable but a few minutes off schedule I booked a tour along the coast for around $700. The boat tour took me from Amalfi and around towards Sorrento and had several spots where I could snorkel and the gorgeous tour guide provided fresh fruit and drinks. He also did an amazing job pointing out landmarks and adding some history lessons to our tour. It was me and about 8 other people. I cannot brag about this amazing experience enough and I hope others look to this tour if they venture out to the coast. The Reginna Palace Hotel helped me with the booking and gave me the most amazing stay.

ItalyTravel,"Warning!

We are travelling in Puglia and we experienced a sneaky scheme of copying our car key fob and going through all our luggage.

We parked in San Stefano parking lot near Cala Verde and in an 1,5 hour almost all our electronics were gone. Macbook, Ipad, a lousy JBL speaker, an electronic toothbrush, a tangle teezer brush, a razor and earpicks and a some makeup, too. 

We suspect the copying and the theft was a part of a scheme done in nearby parking lots. 
There was a young guy cycling in the parking lot, he rode past us and turned around pretty soon. Which felt… somewhat weird.

After coming back from the beach, the doors were unlocked and our luggage was almost neatly packaged. But the unlocked door was a given sign that someone has done something.

All our stuff was stuffed back into our bags. They somehow didn’t take the two pairs of Airpods, but placed them in different spots while repacking. 

They logged out of iPad in the same parking lot and this happened around 15 min before we came back to the parking lot. 

I’ve also read some recent Google reviews from beaches around 5 km from there that experienced thefts in recent days in guarded and paid parking lots.

We are keen travellers and we have never ever had something like this happen to. So please be aware! Take some foil or a foil bag for your car keys and you will be safer.

ItalyTravel,"First trip to Italy and wanted to hit the main tourist attractions (29M travelled with fiancée). This was really the first “trip” we've ever taken since I usually vacation by relaxing for a week in Mexico or a long weekend in Vegas. After doing research I decided that 4 nights in both cities would allow us to see the main tourist attractions but still get to relax in the evening. I highly recommend doing the same and was surprisingly very tired by the end of the trip. Went May 21-30

Florence:

-Stayed at Hotel Spadai and loved it. It was very nice, super clean and in a great location. Absolutely loved the city with its history and ability to walk everywhere. The first day was long after not getting much sleep and taking the train from Rome to Florence. Was lucky that we could check in immediately and freshen up. Stopped at Trattoria Sergio Gozzi for lunch (it was great), and later on grabbed drinks at Giacosa. I’m a huge fan of negronis so I had to stop by, and it was a great experience. The bar tender was fun and a cocktail master.

-2^(nd) day had a guided tour through Viator to see the Academia and Uffizi. Great tour guide and was awesome to see the David and all the artwork in the Uffizi. Got sandwiches next to All'Antico at La Schiacciata because I wasn't going to wait an hour. In the evening got drinks on La Terrazza rooftop bar and loved it. Osteria Santo Spirito was a good choice for dinner.

-3^(rd) day did the Super Chianti small group tour through Grape Tours. Loved it and our tour guide Clemente was my favorite person I met throughout the whole trip. He has an amazing way with words and was able to teach me more about wine while giving me a new perspective on drinking/enjoying wine. Lunch at Dario’s was good but did not see him.

-4^(th) day rented a car and visited Pienza (getting married in villa near by next June). Pienza was a cute little town and the views of Val d’Orcia were breathtaking. Driving in Tuscany was very easy and didn’t have any problems besides when coming back into Florence and driving down a road that was closed. Last meal was at Club Culinario toscanoda Osvaldo and the wild boar tortellini was one of the best bites I had all trip.

I felt super safe in Florence and was not worried about pickpocketing at all. The only “scam” I saw were men standing by their paintings in crowded areas hoping for people to step on them. It was very touristy in the main areas and almost didn’t feel like we were in Italy. The mornings and night were ten times better than the afternoon/evenings with crowds and recommend doing tours early. The food was great overall. You can’t get better meat ragu/meat pastas and the Bistecca did not disappoint, especially for the price compared to the US. This city is unbelievably beautiful and a place I would definitely go again.

Rome:

-Stayed at Dharma Boutique in Monti and it was easily the best hospitality I’ve ever experienced. It’s a small place with only 13 rooms but you feel like the only person there with how great the service is. I enjoyed the Monti area with it’s local shops and restaurants, also very cool to be so close to the Colosseum (what I was looking forward most to seeing). Happy hour from 6-8 every night on the rooftop with prosecco and wine, and a great bar attendant who won’t stop filling your glass. Dinner at La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali was great.

-2^(nd) day we had a guided tour through Viator for the Colosseum with arena access. Also, included the roman forum and palatine hill. The Colosseum did not disappoint and was one of my favorite things of the trip. Later on grabbed drinks in Trastevere before dinner at L’Osteria della Trippa. Trastevere was super packed and had to walk around for a little bit to find a place. Dinner was excellent.

-3^(rd) day started with Trevi fountain at 6:00 am. Took a cab so we could arrive earlier, and it looked like rain so we almost didn’t go. Going so early it was pretty empty and we could take great pictures. We also grabbed a good breakfast at L’Antico Forno. Then we had a guided tour through Viator day had a guided tour through Viator for the Vatican and St. Peters. Places were crowded but nothing was even close to what the Vatican was like. Gradually stepping foot by foot with people on all sides of you throughout the entire tour. The Sistine chapel was great but didn’t love the rest. St. Peters was magnificent. It’s incredible how large and beautiful that church is. Dinner at CiPasso was probably my favorite of the trip. It was the fanciest but still delivered on taste and easily the best service. Truffle crostini is a must have.

-4^(th) day we did the Rome with Chef cooking class. It was a blast. The chefs were fun and interactive, the group was good, and the food & drinks were great. Finished up the trip by walking around Monti, doing a little shopping, and seeing the Colosseum one last time. Had a good dinner at Le Tavernelle.

After hearing many friends say they didn’t enjoy Rome because it was dirty I was surprised by how much I liked it. Of course, it’s not as clean as other places because it’s a large city and graffiti is everywhere but it’s still a beautiful place with history everywhere. Food was excellent everywhere and didn’t have many issues with safety/pickpocketing. The only time was within the first few minutes of visiting the Colosseum a man approached me and touched me pretty aggressively to take a bracelet but I ignored him and all was well. Rome felt much less crowded than Florence and that’s because it’s so much bigger. Once again only doing tours and tourist things in the morning to avoid the larger crowds worked out well. However, being so large we had to take ubers/cabs a few times since we didn’t want to walk over 45 minutes.

Overall, it was an amazing trip, and we were blessed with perfect weather. I did a ton of research between reddit, google, trip advisor and other websites on where to stay, eat and to go for drinks. Having a good basis of knowledge of everything really helped me with not being overwhelmed being on a trip like this. We saw almost everything we wanted and ate & drank everything in sight. I was surprised at how big the portions were, as we would often split an appetizer, order 2 pastas, and then split an entrée with barely being able to finish the entrée. The food is definitely not overrated. By the last day we were both exhausted but couldn’t have been happier with how things turned out.

After getting married in Tuscany next year we plan on honeymooning in Sorrento/Amalfi Coast. I’m very excited to start planning and doing research.

ItalyTravel,"•The locals: absolutely beautiful friendly people. I felt so at home and incredibly welcoming and catered to our needs! Also 90% spoke English which was great for us 😊
• Sight seeing: Oh my God I was in awe at how much there was to look at and admire. We saw the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi fountain, Villa Borghese, Roman forum, Baths of Diocletian, Palazzo Navona and the Palazzo Massimo. There is so much more to see! Also don't underestimate how many steps you will do! We walked 43,000 steps in 4 days!
• The food: Every plate of food we tried was absolutely incredible. I personally had the Carbonara, Prosciutto pizza, Sausage pasta, Tiramissu, Ciabatta sandwiches, Bruschetta starters and Hazelnut gelato. The food is to die for so much flavour!! I also had Bettoga prosecco which was beautiful very citrus but also dry which I love 🥂
• Reconstruction for the Jubilee 2025: We honestly didn't notice the difference. The Trevi fountain was drained for Reconstruction but they had a pool at the side to still throw your coin in! 
• Ubers : Booking an uber was so easy. We were so worried about booking taxis and concerned about the charges and wait times (also the language barrier). All of the taxi drivers spoke English, they were so friendly and pulled up to our hotel within minutes. Prices were roughly €13 for a 10-12 minute journey can't fault the service at all!!

ItalyTravel,"As I write this in the airport I reflect on the highs and lows of the trip that I hope to impart to a prospective traveler. I read a lot of these reviews before going and found them helpful, though I wish I would have invested more time into breaking down the negative reviews. 

Highs: 

—Our primary accommodation. We stayed in Agerola, which is up in the mountains by the Path of the Gods trailhead. We had planned on doing some hiking and the location appeared to be conveniently centralized to Amalfi, Positano, Sorrento, Maiori, Capri, etc. It was a quiet town and always felt super refreshing to make it back at the end of the night. We stayed at a family-owned BnB (Divina Costeria) and they had a fabulous restaurant and were super genuine hosts. The Path of the Gods was wonderful and allowed us to save money and skip on transportation by simply hiking all the way to Positano (5-6 hour round trip at a decent pace). 

Lows:

—Transportation!!! We are very much planners, and had expected to utilize the Sita buses, ferries, and trains efficiently. I deduced the schedule to ink ahead of time and was as prepared as I possibly could have been going in, based on other reviews. What I did not expect was that the schedule didn’t mean anything. Buses flat out would not stop if they were full, and we would spend 2-3 hours at the bus stop, missing our ferries, etc. While the cheap bus tickets looked appealing on paper, we ended up spending over 100 euros several times to go 30 minutes because we risked wasting our entire day/plans. 
Even when a bus would stop, there would be 120 people competing for 60 spots, with no concept of lines. We saw SEVERAL fist fights and poor elderly people get flat out knocked over as soon as the doors would open. It was almost worth spending our whole trip budget to avoid. 
And our host said it wasn’t even as busy as it is in the summer…
So if you are relying on public transportation, make sure you always have a back-up plan. Being in the middle of a bus route is not beneficial.

Takeaway: 

It’s an amazing place, but expect to spend A-LOT of money and stress on transportation if you don’t have a vehicle, and be malleable as your plans will likely be affected. Even the ferries aren’t predictable as they will only go to Sorrento and Naples with even a small amount of wind and weather. We ended up spending about 650 extra euros on transportation when we thought we had it figured out.

2) Will they actually be able to find the convict and get the money back? If yes then how long could it be?

3) if they actually find the person, can I claim the money from India itself?

ItalyTravel,"Returning from our 9-day Italian adventure, we covered Rome, Venice, Florence, Pisa, Salerno, Positano, and Amalfi. As first-timers in Italy, our mid-30s selves embarked without a concrete plan, eager to soak up the country's beauty and culture as much as we can. Our journey wasn't about relaxation but about immersing ourselves fully. Despite a jam-packed itinerary, we never felt rushed, cherishing each moment at our own pace. Every city offered a unique charm, leaving us in awe of Italy's diversity. Though we only scratched the surface, our experience was nothing short of incredible, brimming with excitement, discovery, and a profound appreciation for Italy's wonders.



**- Rome**

***Arrival and First Night:***

We arrived at our hotel in Rome around 10 PM and decided to take a stroll to the Trevi Fountain. To our surprise, even at 10:50 PM, the area was still bustling with people. It was charming to see the fountain illuminated at night, surrounded by tourists and street sellers. We took some photos and then headed back to our hotel.

***Day One:*** 

We left our hotel at 8:00 AM and took the metro to Ottaviano to meet our guide for the Vatican tour. The area wasn't as packed as we expected at that time. However, by 9:00 AM, the crowds started to build up.

**Vatican Tour:** It was a fantastic experience with so much to see. Our tour guide was nice and humorous, making her explanations easy to understand while highlighting the most important aspects. She didn't overwhelm us with unnecessary information, which I appreciated. After the tour, we decided to skip the Basilica and head straight to Piazza Navona. **\*Skip the line is a must for the Vatican Tour**

**Piazza Navona:** On our way here, we stopped by a pizzeria that serves Napoli pizza. Honestly, it was the best pizza I had in Rome. The place was crowded, but that was part of its charm, making the atmosphere so lively. Every alley has its own unique attractions. You have to stroll around to discover various scenes, from people playing music to street vendors and charming cafes. 

**Pantheon:** The architecture is stunning, though there isn't much to see. We snapped a few photos and moved on. As we walked around, we discovered a gelato shop called Giolitti. It was fantastic, offering a wide variety of flavors. There was a short line, but it was definitely worth the wait!

**Spanish Steps:** On the way here, I stopped to purchase Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses, which I've wanted for a while since they're not available in Asia. This made me so happy! There are plenty of shops and cafes to explore around the area. The view from the top of the steps was lovely, especially around 5 pm when it wasn't too crowded. While there's not much to do here, the experience and scenery were worth the visit.

As we were heading back to our hotel on the metro, a young woman approached us with urgency, asking us to follow her. Though hesitant at first, her gentle tug on my shirt convinced us to heed her advice. We quickly boarded the same train, feeling grateful for her intervention. She explained that she had noticed individuals on the platform eyeing us, identifying them as gypsies known for targeting foreigners in the metro. She shared that she sees them often and tries to help whenever she can. Her timely intervention left us feeling thankful for her kindness and vigilant awareness of her surroundings.

***Day Two:*** 

We decided to visit the Trevi Fountain in the morning, so we woke up at 7:00 AM and left at 7:30. On the way, we ran into an older couple from our Vatican tour group. They were really sweet and helped us take photos.

**Trevi Fountain:** The atmosphere during the day is quite different from the night. There were many influencers trying to secure spots in front of the fountain, getting upset when people walked by them. Despite the crowds, it was an enjoyable experience. We stayed for a few minutes, sat, and chatted while admiring the fountain. We truly appreciated the moment. We threw some coins into the fountain and made a wish. Afterward, we headed to our meetup spot for the Colosseum tour.

**Roman Forum & Colosseum Tour:** This place was amazing—the story, the history, and the views. I particularly enjoyed the Roman Forum. Our guide was funny and didn't rush us, even offering to take breaks and checking on us occasionally. He was very caring and passionate about his storytelling, which made the tour much more engaging. The Colosseum was packed! Unfortunately, it started to rain a bit, which was a hassle since we didn't have any umbrellas, and the covered areas were already crowded. Despite this, we enjoyed the tour and took some great photos. **\*Skip the line is a must as well.**

After the tour, we had lunch on the way back to our hotel. We then picked up our things and headed straight to Termini Station, catching a train to Mestre. We stayed there overnight to rest before exploring Venice the next day.



**- Venice**

***Day Three:*** 

After breakfast at the hotel in Mestre, we checked out and boarded the train to Venice. Upon arrival, we left our bags near the station. A word of advice: don't leave your bags inside the station; they offer a service for 6 Euros for the first 4 hours and 1 Euro per hour after. However, if you exit the station on the left side, you'll find a shop that lets you leave your bags for just 5 Euros for the entire day. It's a convenient  for exploring Venice without the burden of luggage. We didn't have itinerary here and just free walk the whole thing.

Venice is undeniably enchanting, with its winding streets and surprise encounters around every corner. Losing your way becomes an adventure in itself, leading to unexpected discoveries like a quiet canal or a street musician adding to the city's lively ambiance. Even stumbling upon dead ends offers a moment to pause and take in the unique beauty of the surroundings, especially with the tranquil canals nearby. The atmosphere buzzes with authenticity as locals and tourists mingle, exchanging smiles and nods of appreciation. It's an experience that captures the essence of Venice's charm and leaves you wanting to explore more.

**Rialto Bridge:** The Rialto Bridge is undeniably picturesque, offering a stunning view of Venice's iconic canals.

**St. Mark's Square & Basilica:** We were absolutely blown away by the beauty of St. Mark's Square and Basilica. It exceeded our expectations in every way. The lively atmosphere, with musicians playing in the cafes and the charming sight of birds soaring overhead, created an unforgettable scene. I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and even got goosebumps seeing it all for the first time. After taking it all in, we wandered around and then enjoyed a delicious lunch in the area.

Around 7 PM, we retrieved our bags and hopped on a train bound for Florence. Venice exceeded our expectations, and even though we only had a day to explore, we made the most of it and thoroughly enjoyed every moment. It's funny to think we almost considered canceling our visit to Venice initially, but we're so glad we decided to go through with it. It turned out to be an unforgettable experience.



**- Florence:**

***Day Four:***

Upon our arrival in Florence, we were greeted by heavy rain, necessitating a taxi ride to our hotel, just a 10-minute walk from the station. Unfortunately, this marked our first unpleasant experience, as the taxi meter quickly climbed to 15 Euros for what should have been a mere 5-minute journey. Despite attempting to voice our concerns, the language barrier left us feeling defeated, and we reluctantly paid the fare. After checking in, we took some much-needed rest.

The following morning, we ventured out to pick up our tickets for the Uffizi Gallery, a short 10-minute walk from our hotel. Arriving around 9 AM, we were pleasantly surprised to find the area relatively uncrowded. With little hassle, we secured our tickets and entered the gallery in less than 10 minutes.

**Uffizi Gallery:** Surprisingly spacious, the Uffizi Gallery exceeded our expectations. We spent about 3 hours leisurely exploring the exhibits, opting for a free-walking approach without a guide or audio guide. It was nice to take our time, stopping to read about the pieces that caught our interest, and the abundance of benches allowed for frequent rest stops. Arriving early was a smart move, as we avoided the crowds, but by 11 AM, the line outside had grown substantially, and the galleries were becoming more congested. Overall, the experience was fantastic, and while audio guides are available for those seeking detailed explanations, we found that a tour guide wasn't necessary unless you're deeply interested in every aspect of the artwork.

Conveniently located near the gallery exit was All’Antico Vinaio, a must-visit spot for a quick bite. We grabbed some sandwiches and then made our way to the train station to catch our ride to Pisa!

**Pisa:** The weather that day was so perfect, we stayed here longer than we thought... Because we tried so hard to get those funny photos beside the pisa haha. I never thought of seeing it in person but it was worth the visit. After taking a rest, we head beack to Firenze.

We ended the night with a delightful steak dinner, thanks to a recommendation from the receptionist at our hotel in Rome. He suggested we use the Fork app to book our reservation, which ended up saving us 30% off the bill. The meal was superb, and afterward, we took a leisurely stroll before calling it a night.

***Day Five:***

Since our Galleria dell'Accademia entrance ticket was for 12:45, we exchanged our voucher and then set off for breakfast, taking the opportunity to wander around the cathedral in the meantime. The area was bustling with activity, with plenty of sights to see and shops to explore, making the time fly by. We made our way back to the gallery around 12:30 and were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves at the front of the line for the 12:45 entrance. The lines are long but was well-organized, and we found that skipping the line wasn't necessary at all.

**Galleria dell'Accademia:** turned out to be smaller than expected, no pun intended. We spent just a short while exploring the artworks and sculptures before deciding to move on. Despite its size, the gallery was still worth a visit.

After our museum visit, we took a leisurely stroll around the area, soaking in the sights and sounds of Florence. Then, we headed back to the hotel to collect our bags before embarking on our journey to Salerno!



**- Salerno**

***Day Six:***

Salerno quickly became our favorite destination, offering a more relaxed and laid-back atmosphere compared to the bustling cities we had visited. It felt like a condensed version of everything we loved about Italy, with the added bonus of easy access to Positano and Amalfi. The food was exceptional, and what truly stood out was the warmth and kindness of the people. In just one day, we were offered help multiple times, whether it was assistance with using a vending machine or directions when we looked lost. Their genuine hospitality made our time in Salerno truly memorable.

We headed to the ferry around 8:30 AM to purchase a one-way ticket to Positano, with the earliest departure scheduled for 8:40 AM. Surprisingly, there was no line, making access easy and hassle-free. The journey from Salerno to Positano takes approximately one hour, with a brief stop in Amalfi along the way. The leg from Salerno to Amalfi itself is a scenic 30-minute ride, offering breathtaking views of the coastline.

  
**Positano:** Positano lived up to its reputation as a must-visit destination. Its beauty was truly captivating, with colorful buildings cascading down the cliffs, charming shops, inviting restaurants, and cozy cafes creating a picturesque scene at every turn. We stopped for a lemon slushie and asked the seller kindly to recommend a nearby restaurant for lunch. It was great and the view was amazing!

After lunch, we stroll along the beach and took some photos. We decided to see Amalfi in the afternoon, Luckily, there was available ferry going to Amalfi on the time we asked. 

**Amalfi:** It was a dream come true for me, a place I've wanted to visit since I was young. Unlike Positano, Amalfi had a more relaxed vibe, which made it easy to enjoy. We had delicious lemon sorbet, a refreshing treat on a sunny day. We spent a relaxing afternoon on the beach and took photos on the way. 

Before leaving, we picked up some souvenirs and headed back to Salerno.

  
***Day Seven:***

We decided to go back to Positano instead of going to Capri. We rented a Vespa scooter to explore the Amalfi Coast. It cost us 70 Euros for the whole day, and we could return it by 9 PM. We rode from Positano to Amalfi, Ravello, Minori, and Maiori before heading back. It was an amazing experience and totally worth it. Riding along the coast was the highlight of our trip to Italy. We returned the scooter around 7pm and went back to Salerno for dinner. 

  
***Day Eight:***

Here, we enjoyed the most laid-back time of our trip. We made a quick visit to the Cathedral of Santa Maria and explored the ancient ruins of Paestum. Afterwards, we took a leisurely stroll around the port area, soaking in the serene atmosphere. It was a peaceful and rejuvenating experience, allowing us to unwind and appreciate the beauty of our surroundings.

***Day Nine:***

After checking out, we enjoyed a delightful breakfast at a cozy meat shop, where the owner warmly introduced us to his daughter, who is training to take over the business. It was a charming moment that added a personal touch to our morning. With coffee in hand, we made our way back to the station to catch our train to Rome and transfer to the airport.

At the airport, we checked in and took the time to savor the souvenirs we had bought during our trip, reminiscing about the unforgettable experiences we had in Italy. As we prepared to board our flight back to Korea, we couldn't help but feel grateful for the wonderful memories we had made and the warm hospitality we had encountered along the way.

ItalyTravel,"I (F21) am traveling alone and was walking today in Naples and in a narrow street that didn't have many people (in spaccanapoli though so very close to the crowds) and a man kind of gestured to hug me as I was walking on the street opposite him and then just came at me, hugged me (wouldn't leave me for a bit) while saying things in Italian and then just kissed me on my cheek, but like very close to my lips - WTH??? who does that?? It was a lonely street off to the side of the big crowded area so I was scared to push him off me cuz I was scared he might do something (I have been assualted before so I just freeze up in situations like these).

EDIT: it was in broad daylight. Also, I do have a sound alarm for things like this but I just somehow froze in the moment and forgot to use it. Also, crowds weren't too far away, u could still see the crowd in the region yet this happened. After the guy kissed me, he started talking to his friend in Italian who was further away, and the friend just looked at me awkwardly then laughed. I don't even think people around me would've done anything as I've seen so many stories where no one helps a woman when something like this happens. It is sad that our world is like this.

ItalyTravel,"Hello, I've been in Italy for almost a month now and have eaten pizza sit down for a total of 4 times. 

I watched a reel where somebody was cutting spaghetti with a knife and fork to get a rise out of an Italian - don't worry, I didn't do this.

However, it triggered a question - have I been eating pizza wrong here?

In Italy, the pizza doesn't come sliced, which I understand is to preserve the integrity of the base. When I saw it, I interpreted it as ""eat it however you want"". The first time round, I was ravenous. A very brief google search didn't reveal if there was a certain way to cut pizza and eat it, so I just got to it. The next couple of times, nobody said anything nor did I notice strange looks (or maybe I'm unaware) so I assumed all was well.

I didn't cut the pizza into triangles as I went. I cut out small squares from the bottom, making my way to the top of the pizza. Think of a bricks breaker game, but circular. Why did I eat like this? I had the most control over what part of the pizza I wanted to eat. Sometimes I want some ingredients and no crust, sometimes I want just crust, sometimes I can't finish all of the crust.

Would I have offended any Italians by doing this? 

Is this a wrong way to eat pizza? Was I being barbaric?

I am a young Asian female and have also been quite conscious and mindful of how I've been representing the groups I could represent visually, so am worried I left a bad impression.

  
The second part of my question, why do restaurants give you two forks? I assume one's for the starter and the second's for the primi/secondi. But in some of my meals, I was given a fork with my starter, resulting in 3 forks at one time on my table, so I'm wondering if there's any other reason other than they just gave me an extra fork.",t2_ha3lgbx2j,"Cutting pizza in Italy, also why do restaurants give you two forks?",0.77,38,1731379058.0,1731379058.0,80,sisterbuysscarybooks,1gpajl3
ItalyTravel,"So I have to finish what I started and do a trip report on Rome, following my previous reports on Venice and Florence. The high-level version is that I adored Rome - it was mind-bogglingly in scope, and I loved how the history of the city is often (literally) written in the stones. I think it may be my highlight of the whole trip, though my experience in Venice remains very special. I can't wait to go back to both places. Some high-level observations below:

1. The traffic is indeed chaotic in Rome, but while dragging my suitcase from Termini to my accomodation near the Coliseum wasn't exactly my idea of a good time I found the wide pavements much more accommodating to a tourist in my situation than the perilously narrow ones in Florence. I also think I'd also found my feet more with navigating Italian traffic as a pedestrian, learning something of the critical Italian art of being assertive and confident when crossing the zebras with no lights.

2. It can't be over-stressed just how large Rome is. While I felt like I had a reasonable grasp of the geography of Venice and Florence after two days in each, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of Rome after spending three days there (it's similar to London in that way). I think the key to enjoying Rome within a few days is making peace with the fact that you won't be able to do many of the available attractions, and you should choose what you do carefully without treating the city as a list of checkboxes to be ticked. For me, taking public transport was essential to getting around, even as I was walking 25k steps a day.

3. I tried to do one major activity a day, followed by more instinctual pursuits/general wandering after. A description of each day follows.

4. On day 1 (after arriving from Florence by train), I explored the area around the Coliseum/Forum and visited two beautiful churches set right up against the edges of the Forum. I then made a mistake - I entered the Forum/Palatine Hill around 2.30pm, without truly appreciating just how vast it was. I spent around 2.5 hours there pretty much in awe of the scope of the area and the many remnants of an ancient past (how wild that you can just stumble across the arches where Caligula was murdered, or the spot where Julius Caesar was cremated!?). It was also large enough that crowds weren't a problem, as everyone was very spaced out. The only place to give me a similar feeling was the Acropolis in Athens - it's magical, and imho far more impressive than the Coliseum itself. I plan to return and give it a full day, as well as joining a guided tour to get more context (there are signs, but the enormity of it all makes it easy to feel lost/overwhelmed). 

5. On day 2, I went to the Coliseum for my timed entry. I'd booked my ticket in advance, and strongly recommend doing the same as the queue for tickets looked long and gruelling, and the people queuing were being bothered by hackers and resellers. The security line went quickly. The Coliseum is very impressive but it's only one building, whereas the Forum/Palatine Hill part offers many. I was quietly horrified when I met some fellow travellers at a restaurant who told me they'd skipped the Forum/Palatine Hill altogether because they didn't realise it was included in their ticket!

6. By day 2 I needed to get away from crowded areas so initiated another movie quest - this time to find locations from Dario Argento's INFERNO, another horror film I love. In this pursuit I went to the Angelika Library, which is centuries old and fascinating. Tourists are only allowed in the front section as people use the space for study, but they had a small and very interesting display of books about magic and superstition - the information was all in Italian, but I still found the books fascinating (and very relevant to my quest given the nature of Argento's films). The church next door to the library is also a must-see - it's a gorgeous building and contains a stunning Caravaggio painting. As they were nearby, I also ticked off the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. All beautiful but none were favourite activities of mine, all being too crowded for my liking (especially the Pantheon). Afterwards I escaped the centre and went to the north of the city to visit the Coppede area, which was also used as a filming location for INFERNO. I greatly enjoyed this - it's a whole district of gorgeously executed buildings combining different artistic styles, but most strongly Art Noveau. It felt right out of a fairy tale and was very peaceful and perfect for photography. I capped off the day with a visit to the tacky Argento pilgrimage site Profondo Rosso, which is a shop selling horror themed tat. It has a small ‘museum’ w/ a few props underneath that's basically a five-minute spook show. It was worth it for me as an Argento superfan, but would be a waste of five euros for anyone else.

7. On day 3 I set out early to the Vatican - I didn't have tickets for the museum (had already been to the Ufizzi, and knew two massive art museums in one trip would be overwhelming for me) but wanted to see St Peter's Basilica. The security queue took an hour but went quickly due to chatting with some nice people in front of me (more on the social side of Rome below). St Peter's itself was staggering and well worth the trip - a nice bonus was that the crypt (the underground burial place of the Popes) was open due to it being early on Saturday. It was amazing to walk through that space and emerge into St Peter's right below the Dome. It was busy but crowds were manageable - was able to get right up close to La Pieta with no difficulty. 

8. For the rest of day 3 I got progressively more esoteric with my activities. I started off with the Jewish Ghetto, which was very interesting - my favourite part was a building that had incorporated ancient carvings and even a headstone (!) into the construction. I then took a bus to get to the Pyramid (awesome!) and the Protestant Cemetery. These were amongst my favourite places in Rome, and I spent a couple of hours taking them in - as a literature fan it was very moving to see the graves of Keats and Shelley, and the view of the Pyramid from the cemetery is spectacular and how it needs to be seen. They ask for a small fee, but it's worth it and then some. The cemetery is also a must visit if you like cats, as it also functions as a cat sanctuary and they are everywhere - my favourite was a ginger cat sunbathing on a grave in front of the pyramid! I then took the metro from Pyramid station down to the E.U.R., and visited the Palace of Italian Civilization. This building is breathtaking and a must-see if you have any interest in architecture. It's surrounded by an ugly metal fence and I initially thought it was going to be closed, but luckily the security gate was open and there were several other people (mostly Italian) inside chilling and taking photos. While the building has an unsettling fascist history, it's an amazing achievement and looks beautiful from every angle. Visiting it felt like experiencing the pure grandeur and beauty of the temples in the Forum when they were still new and immaculate. It was the perfect cap to my last full day in the city.

9. I only had a few hours in the morning of day 4 so spent them on a final wander around the area of my hotel. I found yet more parts of the Forum (viewable from above for free) before wandering over towards the place where Julius Caesar was murdered (which also doubles as a cat sanctuary!), which consists of the ruins of various buildings. I made it out to Tiber Island, which has an interesting history, before I had to head back to my hotel and depart for the airport.

10. I found people in Rome (mostly other tourists) the friendliest of any other stage of my holiday. I had lots of nice chats in queues, and made friends with another group of women from England in line for a casual restaurant - so much so that we dined together! It was a great experience and a nice social element to what has otherwise been a solo adventure.

11. I've seen lots of complaints about public transport in Rome, but I had virtually zero problems - buses were frequent and efficient, and the metro ran very smoothly and was never over-crowded for the sections I used. I got the 48-hour Atac pass, which was perfect for me - the only small snag was when a validator was broken on a bus, which meant I had to get off and catch the next one (my fear of a fine being too great). 

That's obviously a lot of words so I'll leave it there - suffice to say I had the best time and am already dreaming about returning, even as I'm on the plane home. Italy is an amazing country with perhaps the most fascinating history of any place I've visited. I couldn't have hoped for a better introduction to Italy, and am feeling very lucky and privileged.

ItalyTravel,"My wife and I just returned from our 18 day trip to Italy. 



Rome - 4 nights 

Climbing St. Peter's Basillica was definitely a highlight. We got there at 7am and there was already a line that took 20 minutes to get through. Later in the afternoon, the line literally wrapped around St. Peter's square. There is no way to reserve a timed entry, so you just show up and wait. The artwork, the dimension, the history -- wow. 

The Vatican Museums, on the contrary, were very unpleasant. So many people squeezing through tight corridors and jostling into one another that it was impossible to relax and just enjoy the exhibits.

Going inside the Colliseum and Forum were well worth it and quite interesting. 

We did go to the Trevi Fountain to see what the excitement was about, and it was beautiful, but there were plenty of slightly smaller fountains around Rome that were not nearly as crowded. We also tried going to the Pantheon, but the lines were so long and we were exhausted, so that didn't end up happenning. That whole area of Rome was wayyyy overcrowded. 

We stayed in the Trastevere neighborhood, which was definitely a great choice. The shop ""Fatamorgana"" had the best gelato we had in Italy. So many unique flavours (such as spicy chocholate + wasabi) as well as typical classics. We went there at least twice a day. This area as well as the neighborhood immeditaley to the north accesed by crossing the Tiber river were really enjoyable to roam through and take in the atmosphere, markets, history, etc. 

The food in Rome was mixed in terms of quality. We found some really great ones near our apartment rental as well as the chain Eataly and then some overpriced low quality ones. I will say that due to religious reasons, we don't eat pork or shellfish/seafood which heavily limited our options. The food throughout the rest of the trip tended to follow this theme of limited options based on our dietary restrictions, some good quality, some poor quality. In some places, such as Cinque Terre, we ended up doing groceries and cooking our own food, because it was so much easier and cheaper to cook than to find restaurants  that weren't mostly or entirely seafood based. 

Being able to be so immersed in history so close up and wandering around were the major highlights of Rome. We saw a random pyramid on the side - turns out it is 2,000 years old and was modelled after those in Egypt. The transport in Rome was really unreliable and the sidewalks were very narrow and busy. We liked Rome, but were also happy to head to somewhere more quiet. 



Riomaggiore - 4 nights 

Cinque Terre is stunning. There are rail/hiking passes which may or may not be worthwhile to pay for, depending on what you are planning to do. The stairs are no joke. Be prepared to do a lot of lifting of luggage. 

Between exploring villages, hiking, going to the beach, eating, etc, three full days + 1 half/travel day were definitely the perfect amount of time for us. 

We didn't spend much time in Manarola, but we got a feel for the other four villages: Vernazza is the most picturesque (in my opinion) - getting a look out from a bit above town on the hiking path was breathtaking; Riomaggiore (where we stayed) is the best in terms of mixture of ammenities - beauty, accessibility to wider Italy and La Spezia, (rock) beaches and rocks in the harbour to relax on and enjoy the views; Corniglia is unlike the others as it is perched high up above a mountain - had an amazing cannolo in one of the cafes here; Monterrosso is the most typical beach town in terms of appearance and an actual sandy beach. 

We considered taking a ferry to Lerici, but we ended up being busy with other things + not wanting to spend the money on the exhorbitant ferry fare. In early June, Cinque Terre was not nearly as busy as I expected it to be. 



Florence - 4 nights 

Like Rome, the history and architecture were highlights, though Florence is more Renaissance focused obviously. We found Florence to be a bit more relaxing and manageable due to the compactness of it. It is very easy to take a quiet side street or alley and walk to all the main sites within 20 minutes. We stayed on the Piazza della Passera, which was a fantastic location. 

We went to the Uffizi gallery, which although nice, didn't wow us. We much more enjoyed climbing the Duomo. The painting on the ceiling..... I am still in awe weeks later. The dimensions, the way it draws you in and then you see figures and limbs flying out at you, just so enchanting. We spent a good 20 minutes inside the Duomo on the deck just looking up at the ceiling. 

The leather market was fun. We got shoes, wallets, and bags that were much cheaper than we would have found elsewhere. The salespeople (who were mostly Indian for some reason?) don't mind being bargained with, so don't settle for the first price they give you. Another thing to note is that VAT is 22% in Italy, so if paying them in cash, insiting on a discount of that rate is just a smart thing to do. We ended up bargaining them down by about 50%. 

We did a pasta making course (called Pastamania on Airbnb) that was well worth it. We learned new skills, had fun, met other travellers, and had a nice meal at the end. We also did another cooking course which was listed as ""family friendly,"" which turned out to be disappointing. 

We did a Vespa tour, where we were trained to drive the vehicles and then drove in the Tuscan hills stopping at a few nice sites along the way. This was pricey, but well worth it. 



Ortesei (Dolomites) - 5 nights 

We stayed in Hotel Luna Mondschein, which we loved. Two pools, sauna, steamroom, amazing included breakfast, comfortable room with balcony, near center of town. Couldn't have been better. Ortesei is easy to get to with a bus (that my wife calls the ""vomit bus"") from Bozen/Bolzano. Once in town, a car is really not necessary, as there are two cable cars and a funicular to adjacent mountain tops and a bus pass is provided to overnight lodgers. Cable car passes are available, which may or may not be worth it depending on what you want to do. One of the cable cars leads to a huge alpine meadow, while the other leads to a dramatic ridgeline known as ""Seceda"".

We are not huge hikers but were still able to enjoy the Dolomites with the use of the lifts. Athletic activities of all kinds (e.g mountain climbing, paragliding, etc) as well asmore cultural activities are available. 

The Dolomites actually did a great job at managing tourists and tourist infrastructure nicely. There is a help center in town with helpful infomration and friendly staff, nice brocures, and they manage to spread people out so it doesn't feel too packed. Culturally, the Dolomites are more German than Italian. It was an interesting shift to still technically be in Italy but feel like it was Austria or Southern Germany. Most people speak Italian, German, and English, so communication wasn't a problem. The German dialect is different than standard German, which I as a German speaker found quite fun to listen to. The cusine is also more Germanic. 

Unfortunately the weather while we were there was horrible. We got caught in rainstorms multiple times while just walking around town. Apparently the weather we had was unusual for the time of year. Almost every day, it would rain for most of the day and then the sun would come out, vaporize the rain, and fog/clouds would develop that largely obsucred the views and scenery. We even got hailed on atop a mountain. Seceda was snowy and cloudy so that was less than ideal. 

We still enjoyed our time here, but by day five, we got tired of playing banagrams at our hotel while waiting for the sun to come out.



Venice - 1 night before our flight home

This was just a quick stop before our flight home. Venice was nice to stroll about, but we weren't that enthralled with it. After an hour or two, we felt like we got the idea. Hotels are very pricey and I think staying elsewhere in Veneto and doing a Venice day trip might be more worthwhile. 

  
Final Notes: 

We never felt unsafe, though we were paranoid about pickpockets and extra vigilant about that. We did encounter forceful sales people and ""petitioners,"" which kind of amused me.

The places we went to were obviously heavily touristed and we knew that going in. We really enjoyed them all, but we did start getting tired and burnt out towards the end. I am happy we visited where we did, but I don't think I'd rush back to any of these places soon. We are talking about going back to Italy and maybe seeing Puglia, Sardinia, more rural Tuscany, or elsewhere in Liguria. I have been to San Remo before and I really liked it. 

All opinions are obviously subjective. I know this was very long, so I'll stop here, but feel free to ask any questions.

ItalyTravel,"This is a cross between a PSA and a friendly reminder originating from local news: yet another tourist, without proper mountain clothing and equipment, a couple of days ago was trapped on a mountain path and rescued by state SAR specialists.

The Dolomiti are a 100km long *mountain range*. Not a funny theme park, not a cozy neighboorhood of Venice, not an open-air mall...they're mountains. And like any other mountains everywhere in the world there's an inherent danger when you start walking all across them.

When you go hiking, please stay safe and  apply basic safety tips:

* always plan your route *beforehand* on an *actual hiking map*. Not on Instagram, not on random websites, not on tourist billboards onsite nor on those simplified free maps you find in hotels. Needless to say, carry your hiking map with you

* always check weather forecasts the day before the hike and before starting it, on reliable weather channels (www.meteoam.it is a good start for Italy, it's a public service website managed by our Air Force)

* be aware of and respect your limits: physical/mental limits and time. If you're tired, you're tired. If you're scared, you're scared. If it's getting dark and you're behind your schedule...you know the drill. Stop and rest when needed, turn around and go back if it's advisable to do so 

* your smartphone is not a light source, a map, a reliable knowledge repository. Don't assume you will have reception anywhere

* wear hiking clothes appropriate for the season and the weather. Pack a rain poncho plus a windbreaker just in case - weather and temperatures in the mountains  can change drastically in a few minutes

* If you don't wear hiking shoes/boots you've already tested beforehand then you should not be on a trail. Period. *Do not* hike  on unknown trails with normal shoes or untested mountain boots/shoes - if something happens to your feet you're dead in the water until someone picks you up and carry home

* always share your hiking plan with your hotel staff. If help is needed and you cannot communicate they will share the information with local law enforcement/SAR personnel


The emergency number in Italy is 112,  the same for all EU countries. If you need an official guide or an informed assessment of your hiking trip look for the nearest CAI office - the *Club Alpino Italiano* (alpine Italian club) is the oldest hiking and mountaineering association in Italy, founded in 1863. It's full of friendly mountaineers and has offices/chapters almost in every mountain town and city


If you need help don't hesitate to call 112, but be advised: SAR personnel will assess on arrival why you called them.

If they assess the caller is not injured or feeling ill (i.e. is simply tired, unable to move due to lack of hiking equipment, etc.) then the full cost of the rescue operation will be billed on the person(s) involved - that means personnel cost, equipment, vehicles  and so on. A clueless tourist may rack up tens of thousands of euro in bills plus fines.

The number of unprepared/underequipped tourists wandering on the Alps is rising every year since the end of the COVID emergency. Groups of people with t-shirts and sneakers in the snow, solo wannabe climbers without helmets and maps, couples with kids and dogs wandering off trail because they misunderstood some influencer' directions...don't join the lemming horde.

Plan your hikes with the same care you plan your trip.

ItalyTravel,"Just got back from our mini tour of the three cities and we packed a lot in 7 days but it was worth it! So we are originally from NYC.

Milan

* It was almost comparable to NYC honestly LOL
* We just saw the Duomo and the Galleria, nothing crazy going on in the city TBH

Venice

* It was super dreamy, I loved it. We stayed on the main island and took the 4L bus to Venice St. Lucia.
* So here you have to worry about the pick pocketers esp on the Rialto bridge. I called one out and she cursed me out LOL. Then she went behind me near a corner and smoked a cigarette while she had her fake pregnant belly?!! There were a few men that looked sus and I thought they could be pick pocketers too.
* We did our trip super budgeted so we didn't get on any of the gondola rides but its okay you're not missing out much. We did take the water taxis!! Don't be afraid to use them!!
* Food scene was great

Rome

* There are TONS of things to see, if you want to stick to just touristy things def give yourself 3-4 days.
* There was tons of police presence near the Trevi fountain and throughout the busy areas honestly I wouldn't worry about the pick pocketers here. In general ppl were nice to let ppl in and take pictures so don't get scared of the crowd when you see it near the fountain.
* Food scene also really great! Don't be afraid to try the seafood!
* Yes the colosseum is as magnificent and grand as you hear. The hype is REAL.
* We stayed at a hotel kind of far from the main attractions, we stayed near Villa Borghese and honestly it was kind of hard. Not too many taxis are around and it was hard calling for them. I personally had a hard time with taxis in Rome.
* Speaking of, since we were so deep into the suburbs of Rome, all restaurants close from like 3-almost 9-10PM, which is normal so just be prepared for that.

Overall, we are from NYC so we didn't mind the Italians attitude towards us, I dunno its bc we are tourists, or the color of our skin, etc. I didn't think they were that hospitable to be completely honest. We can agree to disagree.

Bullet trains, trains from the airport, etc are pretty straightforward although I couldn't figure out the Rome's public transportation metro card thing.

**Some helpful tips:**

* Have some euros on hand
* Use a phone strap. Honestly most places take apple pay/ digital card so you can just travel with your phone you will be fine.
* The street sellers can get aggressive just stand your ground
* **Travel light** omg why were some ppl traveling with big a$$ suitcases?!!

ItalyTravel," 
This is my first time to Europe; however, I have traveled throughout Asia and Africa. I also travel with a budget-conscious mindset. Please keep this in mind!


1. Safety. My husband and I were always together except for a few short periods when we ventured off separately in Florence.  I never felt unsafe in Rome or Florence day or night, but honestly, I would not have enjoyed walking to/from Termini in Rome in the dark alone as a woman. 

2. Pickpocketing.  Do not flaunt expensive items/do not be dumb.  This simple advice should prevent you from being pickpocketed.  After reading many posts about theft, I thought to myself, surely this cannot be worse than any other major city I have been to, as these posts make it seem as if pickpocketing is rampant. Perhaps it is, but I followed the same precautions that I use elsewhere in the world (basic sling bag over chest), and was fine.  Husband kept phone and wallet in front pocket. No need to purchase a special “pickpocket-proof” bag unless you really need that peace of mind.  

3. High-Speed Trains. Book tickets at least several weeks in advance to get the best price/preferred time.  Second class was more than sufficient for us, but I did get business class seats for one trip for nominally more than second class, and I did enjoy the snacks and bigger seats.  I did not pay extra for a flexible ticket.  These tickets do not have to be validated. 

4. Regional Trains.  We took a regional train to/from Empoli for our visit to Vinci.  Booked tickets the night before with no issue.  These tickets do have to be validated, which can be done using a link on your phone (if purchased online).

5. Bus/Metro.  We were not in Rome long enough to purchase a multi-day pass/we only made one roundtrip trip, so we just used the Tap-And-Go on the bus and metro, which was way easier than figuring out the paper ticket system.  We also used Tap-And-Go in Florence for the bus ride to/from Fiesole.  For Tap-And-Go, just tap your credit card, and it automatically provides you a validated ”ticket”. Note: each person must use their own credit card.  We were never checked, but evidently you would just have to provide your credit card to prove you purchased a ticket.  The Tap-And-Go was usually at the front of the bus. Note: the credit card charge lagged (I did not see some charges until hours or days later).

6. Cell service.  My Verizon (US) phone is locked, so I could not use an e-sim. I made a one-time upgrade to a plan that includes unlimited calls/texts abroad, and 10 MB data for $25, which was considerably cheaper than Verizon’s $10/day international plan.  This plan was more than sufficient, as all of our stays had Wi-Fi.  My cell service was so-so, so I definitely appreciated the Wi-Fi availability (thick stone walls certainly impact service!)

7. Airport Transfer. We took the bus from FCO to Termini for 7 euros per person.  Buses are frequent (every 15 minutes or so).  Our flight landed early AM, so we were not in a rush.  Trip took about an hour.  To save time, take the Leonardo Express (14 euros per person; trip is about 30 minutes).  

8. FCO Arrival.  Passport control is automated for a handful of countries (US, Britain, Australia, plus a few others), and so this went very quickly.  No forms required for these countries. Can’t speak to baggage claim, as we only brought a carry-on. 

9. FCO Departure.  Security and passport control went very quickly.  Waiting to see a Delta gate agent was excruciatingly slow. I needed to see a gate agent to check in, as I was having issues with the app.  Unless you have to see a gate agent, just use the kiosk to check in and print bag tags.  Also of note, the Delta counters did not even open until 6:15/6:30 am.

10. Money.  Absolutely do not exchange money at the airport, or any exchange place for that matter.  The best exchange rate for cash is using an ATM.  I recommend opening a Charles Schwab Investor Checking account, and throwing in $500/$1000.  This account refunds ATM fees, and can be used abroad with no fees. Also, do not accept the conversion rate at the ATM if asked. This being said, bring some cash as backup in case your cards don’t work.

11. Credit cards vs. cash.  I primarily used my credit card, but did use cash for small purchases (10 euros or less) and at the leather market in Florence.  I don’t like to carry around cash, and credit cards are easily locked if an issue arises (which it never did for us).

12. Tipping. I tipped our housekeeper 5 euros for watching/keeping our bags, and one of our waiters 5 euros for exceptional service.  Otherwise, I did not tip, as I read it is not necessary nor encouraged. 

13. Eating In.  Conad and Carrefour stores are well stocked with groceries and very cheap bottles of wine. 

14. Privacy. Italy (and the EU) have stronger privacy laws than the US. Do not take photos of strangers, and absolutely do not take photos of the police. ",t2_d5u2ndw0,General Tips & Tricks ,0.88,39,1714481580.0,1714481580.0,35,kwandika,1cgs3w5

ItalyTravel,"As part of our journey through Abruzzo, Puglia, and Umbria, my wife and I first visited Abruzzo. The Lonely Planet guide to Italy dedicates less than 10 pages to this region, which is truly undeserved! Abruzzo is a stunning area where, within an hour, you have everything at your fingertips—historic towns, nearly 3000-meter-high mountains, and the sea. It’s a paradise for outdoor activities. My wife and I hiked from Campo Imperatore to Corno Grande, and along the coast, we cycled a beautifully maintained 42 km route from Ortona. The small towns like Pacentro and Loreto Aprutino are a delight, and Chieti is equally charming.

What impressed us most was the unspoiled nature. From the balcony of our little house, we could watch wild boars and foxes at dusk. In the national parks, you can also see wolves and bears (though we didn’t encounter them). During our six-day stay, we met only two other foreign couples; everyone else was local. In the restaurants, there’s no sign of tourist rip-offs—you feel at home.

However, we were saddened to see how many homes in towns like Chieti, Sulmona, and even Ortona are empty, and in Caramanico Terme, many hotels are closed. Could any locals explain why these towns are becoming so rapidly depopulated? And why are the hotels in Caramanico Terme sitting empty? It's a truly beautiful place in a fantastic location, easily comparable to a Swiss alpine town.

Thank you.

ItalyTravel,"Ciao! Based off the positive response, I wanted to continue to share some more learnings.   
  
\-	The rail system is fantastic. We took the highspeed train from Rome to Florence and arrived in a little under 90 min.  One item I wanted to call out, because I was confused as well, you do NOT have to “check in” on the high speed trains. I spoke to a Trenitalia representative, and she said you only need to check in on the “regional” trains.   
\-	The Tuscan wine country region is stunning. Can’t even compare it to Napa (which we loved). This area deserves more than a day trip tour and so glad we spent two nights (still not enough time) in Montepulciano. We will definitely be back.   
\-	Hopping from city to city sounds like a good idea, but we are so glad to finally have settled in our apartment in Florence. We are 5 days into our trip and I will say packing and unpacking is tiresome. Throw in the commuting, and it’s exhausting.   
\-	Wineries in Montepulciano and Montalcino are excellent, but make a note that you should try and make a reservation ahead of time…especially if you are visiting during peak season.   
\-	You need a car to get around. Also roads in Tuscany are narrow and windy. We had a small little economy car which handled everything fine, but we were weary to have a late dinner far away. There is little to light illuminating the roads and some roads are straight up gravel.   
\-	We had some great meals during our stay here:  
o	Porta di Bacco – everything we had was excellent here…star of the show was the Artichoke Flan.   
o	La Vineria – Perfect place to get an apertivo. Get the appetizer board for 10 Euro and an aperol spritz for 6 Euro. Was almost enough food for a dinner  
o	Fonte all Vena – Michelin guide ristorante with an excellent offering. The truffle risotto and censa pork ribs were tremendous  
o	Osmosi – 1 Michelin star restaurant with multiple tasting menu options. Food and service was exquisite.

ItalyTravel,"Salve amici,   
I make the space to go to Italy once or twice a year and have spent a fair amount of time on the ground over the years.  Around 50 days total in Florence, 20ish in Rome, 10 in Lucca, etc., obviously not enough to really get down into the experience but definitely enough to have done the 'big things' that tourists usually do.  The last several trips I've taken have involved new places, smaller towns, etc, and I'm heading back in June to Ischia, Frascati and back to Rome (where I'm meeting my spouse, who has only seen Rome for one short day).  


So basically I want to hear your recommendations for the lesser known sights for folks like me who keep going back and try something new every time.  Far North to waaaaaay South to Sardinia to Le Marche to wherever. I want it all lol  


Some of my top recommendations:  
**ORVIETO.**  Just 90 minutes north of Rome, charming as hell, beautiful, easy to get around, tons of Etruscan history, beautiful Duomo, and Umbria has killer vineyards and farms which makes for extremely good food.  Worth at least two nights, but can be done as a day trip if you must.  Ebike tour will be your best bet to see a lot in a short amount of time.  


**BRACCIANO, specifically to truffle hunt.**  Again, just north of Rome, easy train ride, stunning castle with tons of artifacts, GORGEOUS lake, beautiful little town.  The truffle hunt in the countryside was something I'll never forget!  One of the best days of my life, truly.  


**SAN MINIATO AL MONTE church while the monks chant.**  Florence, just a bit above Piazzale Michelangelo.  I'm not religious in the slightest but love visiting churches.  The monks chanting in the STUNNING church, the cemetery, the grounds, the view of Florence... it's a lot to take in and is incredibly moving.  


**FATTORIA AL DOTTO WINERY just outside Lucca.**  Best wine tasting experience of my life.  Insanely good food with each glass of wine (yes, the tasting pours are HUGE), extremely good wine, friendly people, crazy gorgeous views over the Lucchese hills.  Take the bus up from Lucca, get absolutely sauced, get a cab back down.  


**MASSA LUBRENSE just past Sorrento.**  I love Sorrento, a lot.  I could spend a lot of my time there, but if I LIVED in that area, it'd be in Massa Lubrense.  Take an ebike tour that guides you up the hill into this charming, seriously gorgeous location heading into the Amalfi Coast.  Views to die for, extremely good olives, lemons, cheeses, meats and all the products that relate to them.  It was heaven on earth.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all. So I completely missed all the stereotypes around Italian drivers, I genuinely envisaged that the driving style on roads would mirror my idea of Italy as life 'in the slow lane'. This was almost the most wrong I've ever been about something.

I went to Northern Italy for a few days last week on an extended road trip and nothing could have prepared me. The main challenge was the overwhelming number of lorry drivers - the second was the speed of car drivers. I drove as fast as I could in so far as it felt safe for me, but for the several hours I drove there it was pure focus and living on the edge. I had the thought I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. I'm a defensive driver in real life, got a few speeding fines here and there, but I'm not a fast driver as I'm just afraid this day will be my last on the road, nor am I the slowest. How can I improve my driving skills that driving faster feels more comfortable? Anything? lol I want to go back with a car but despite being a bit more experienced I'm going to be nervous if I don't better prepare.

Couple of edits for clarity: 1. By northern Italy, I mean the entire northern region and not Milan and above Milan - that area is very north and the most smoothest to drive in 2. I live in Switzerland so I'm used to good driving standards - I know some areas in the US are comparatively worse in general but I've never driven there 3. I rate Italian drivers quite highly - they are skilled and patient drivers (sounds contradictory I know). I just found the speeds and sustaining of those speeds and that in amongst so many trucks (all the time trucks on the motorways) made the overall experience a lot more intense than what I'm used to.

ItalyTravel," I just returned from 10 days in Milan and Florence with some day trips in between.   It was my first time to Milan and second to Florence.   Some things that observed:

- Pickpockets- We went 9 out of 10 days without incident.   We traveled in a group of 4 so we were constantly watching out for each other.   One couple left a day before us and I got too comfortable and wasn't paying attention.  Walking from the Florence train station towards the city center, a guy opened one of my backpack pockets.  Luckily a local caught him and nothing was taken (it was empty anyway) but it did teach me a lesson. 

  
- Trains- Trenitalia app is the way to go.  Easy to buy ticket and on Android I was able to use my Google Wallet to pay so I didn't need to input credit card information.   We would always buy the Base Class which allowed us to make changes if needed.  Comes in handy if you get tired and want to return early or if you are running late.  I had to input the information of the other travelers and when I added an e-mail for them, they got a copy of the ticket in case they needed it.  I set up an account before I left the US.  

  
-Food- We had a list of ""Tik Tok"" spots saved but we often just looked up spots on the go.   Almost every location asked us if we had reservations but still sat us right away when we told them we didn't.   The most we waited was about 5 minutes.   If a location had crazy wait times, we just looked for another spot.  There are so many restaurants to choose from.  We just stayed away from anything directly next to tourist attractions.   We had one incident that we laugh about now.  After along day of walking around Milan, we found a place called The Manzoni about a block from the Opera House.   They asked if we had a reservation and we said no and the hostess immediately asked us to follow her and they took us all the way to the back and gave us the last table in the corner.   It wasn't crowded and there were other tables available.   We didn't think much of it until we left.  By then the restaurant was crowded by what looked like supermodels.   We figured they tried to hide us in the back so we wouldn't be seen.  Food was good and I would recommend it. 

  
Day Trips

-Genoa- We were jetlagged so we only did a half day trip there.  It's easy to get lost in the alleys because you have limited cell reception there.   The cathedral is beautiful and my wife enjoyed the aquarium.  

  
-Lake Como- It was rainy/gloomy most of the day so it wasn't too crowded.  We did the Como-Bellagio-Varenna route.   We skipped the high speed ferry and instead took the bus.   They have busses that go hourly and it only took an hour while the high speed ferry was less frequent.   Out of all three locations, we enjoyed Varenna the most.  Not as touristy as the others.  The train back was a bit crowded but we were able to get a seat.  I definitely recommend buying the ferry before you get there or as soon as you arrive.   

  
-Lugano- We loved this city but very expensive.   We didn't plan as well so we didn't get to go up the funicular.   It is Switzerland so payment is in Swiss Francs but most street vendors took Euros. We paid with credit card at a restaurant.   

  
- Tuscany Wine Tour-  We did a 12 hour tour that included Pisa, San Gimignano, and Siena.  I would not recommend this.  So much time is spent on the bus with only about an hour at each location.  The wine tour was just a restaurant in San Gimignano with some pasta to go with it.  

  
-San Gimignano- We loved this town that we decided to go back on our own.   We took a bus to Poggibonsi then switched to another bus.   We were able to buy one ticket for both at the bus station in Florence.   Very crowded but lots to see.  

  
We learned a lot this trip. The first time we had hour by hour scheduled and we saw a lot but I think we missed out on a lot too because we were so focused on getting to attractions.  This time we took it easy but also missed out on some stuff because we didn't plan as much.  I think there is a happy in between where you take it easy but schedule the important locations so you don't miss out.  Don't over do it.

ItalyTravel,"Here is my report from my trip to Italy during the last 2 weeks of May 2024, and some observations I made that I think may be of interest

Trains- The high speed trains tend to be on time. The train that we took from Milan to Cinque Terre, which wasn't high speed, was delayed by 40 minutes. We also saw a train that was delayed by 1.5 hours. We were a party of 4 and I actually paid extra to choose our seats so that we can all sit together facing each other with a table in the middle. However, the actual seats on the train seem to be different from the seating plans online. As a result, we ended up being split up. I thought I made a mistake but I see this happening to other tourists too. In fact, of all of the train rides where I paid extra to reserve seats, we ended up being split up. The only train ride where we actually managed to sit together was the one where I did not pay the reservation fee and the system just put us together lol.

Toilets - The toilets in Italy are atrocious. Many of them do not have toilet seats, even in restaurants that I consider to be decent.

Milan - We walked up to the rooftop of the Duomo. Honestly, I don't think it is worth going up at the moment since they are going through some renovations so the views are partially obstructed by some of the boards that they put on. I think the Duomo is best enjoyed from the outside and from the inside

Pisa - We were able to buy tickets to walk up the Pisa Tower on the spot, though there weren't many spots left at the moment.   We only stayed the morning in Pisa, as I was told that most people only go to Pisa for the Square of Miracles. However, I wished that we had also stayed the entire afternoon there. The pedestrian streets from the Square of Miracles to the Arno River were actually quite nice and I wished that we had the time to have lunch there and stroll around there leisurely.

Florence - We only spent 1.5 days there. However, it should deserve a minimum of 2 days. For the La Galleria dell'Accademia, even if you bought tickets online, you need to go to a location across from the museum to pick up the physical tickets. We didnt know until we asked one of the staffs. There are so many lines outside for each timeslot and it can seem chaotic. The entrance to the Uffizi Gallery, on the other hand, is much more orderly. We started walking up to Piazzale Michelangelo at 9pm, and it was 10pm by the time we got there. We actually weren't sure if it was a good idea to go up there so late at night, but to our surprise, there was still quite a bit of people up there. The only issue is that it will be colder at that time of the night so it would be a better idea to go during sunset.

Rome/Vatican -  We started lining up outside St. Peter's Basilica at 9:30 am on a Thursday, and the queue has already looped around the square once and then went straight down the center of the square. However, the line was actually moving fast and we got in at 11am after going through the security check. When we got out around noon time, the line was much shorter and it only looped around the square 3/4 of the way.We went to the Vatican Museum in the afternoon. Even though we pre-purchased tickets online, the lines to get inside were very chaotic. Once inside, there were so many people that we just feel like we were being shuffled from room to room. I must however admit that the Sistine Chapel was spectacular though.

Capri - This was probably the favorite part of our trip. We did a boat ride around the island with Laser Capri. We also went up mount Solaro on the chairlift. We stayed at a house in Anacapri and the taxi from the port of Capri to Anacapri costs 35 euros. There are buses that run from Capri to Anacapri. You can buy bus tickets at kiosks but we were able to buy them from the driver directly when the kiosks closed at night

Pompeii- Pompeii is so large that I would budget 4 hours for it. I would actually highly recommend getting a tour guide. We tried going on a group tour with a guide but he won't start until he finds 10 people for the tour (that or we needed to pay more for a private tour). We gave up and toured Pompeii on our own, but we feel we missed out so much without a guide. There is a left luggage office on the 2nd floor of the train station. It closes at 7pm on the day that I was there. They charge 6 euros per luggage

Naples - This is definitely a gritty city, there is no way around this. There are parts of Naples that are filled with garbage and sometimes you just had to wonder whether you are in a first world country. However, some of our most memorable experiences were also in Naples. We actually had dinner at Trattoria da Nennella, which happened to be one of the most famous restaurants in Naples. Their 3 course meal only costs 15 euros. Best of all, the waiters got up on chairs and sang and danced to famous Italian songs and the entire restaurant clapped along. The atmosphere was quite lively and it was quite an experience. As far as I can see, most of the customers there are Italians. We were in Naples for 2 nights during the weekdays and on each night, we would see random fireworks late at night.

Matera- The city is famous for its rock-cut buildings. It is also where the last James Bond movie was filmed. We had to take a 4 hour bus ride from Naples to get there, and the scenery that we see on the bus ride was spectacular. We tried hiking across the Suspension Bridge to the Belvedere Murgia Timone but we didn't have enough time so we gave up half way. The hike down to the suspension bridge and then up to the hill is actually much harder than it seems. For one thing, there is a lot of broken glass bottles on the hike down. Also there is a foul smell once you get close to the suspension bridge and close to the river. You should definitely have proper footwear to attempt this hike.

Venice - We flown into Venice and decide to take the boat with Alilaguna  to get to our accommodation. We actually waited 1.5 hours for the boat because each of the boats is so small that 2 boats came and left without us (they come once every 30 minutes) I would definitely recommend people to take the bus instead! We stayed in the Cannaregio neighborhood, which was actually quite pleasant because it wasn't overcrowded like the rest of Venice. The food here is cheaper too.  With regards to the Gondola, our gondolier only took us on the quieter, smaller canals. However, he was an excellent tour guide and did tell us about the history behind some of the buildings that we passed by. We just wished that he also took us to the Grand Canal as well, which seems more scenic.",t2_gbsqr2ea,Observations and tips from Italy - May 2024 ,0.85,34,1718601311.0,1718601311.0,48,Bloodyhell_666,1dhqfty
ItalyTravel,"Hi!

My husband and I traveling to Italy this September and will have 2 days to spend in either Venice or Florence. We are already spending the rest of our trip in Rome and the Amalfi Coast and would like to fit a 3rd city in. We are debating between Venice and Florence. Here are our pros and cons. Would love your advice and recommendation on which city to pick.

More about our interests: We don't care to visit museums, which I know Florence has a lot of, so that doesn't appeal to us at all. We love food, architecture, sightseeing, and beautiful scenery.

**Venice**

Note: If we go to Venice, it will be from Sept. 19-21, after the Venice Film Festival so hopefully it's less crowded during this time.

Pros:

* Beautiful, romantic city where the city itself is the art
* Smaller city so we can see more in 2 days and won't feel like we're being rushed or jam-packing our schedule
* Can take it slow exploring the city on our last few days in Italy before we fly home

Cons:

* More touristy and smaller city than Florence, so potentially more crowded
* More expensive than Florence
* Would have to change our flight to fly out of Venice (currently flying out of Rome), which is \~$150 extra per person
* Further out than Florence and would be a longer transport to get to Venice from Rome

  
**Florence**

Pros:

* More convenient city to fit into our current schedule as we will be in the Amalfi Coast and Rome. If we go to Florence, we would start in the Amalfi Coast, go to Florence, then end and fly out of Rome.
* We won't have to change our flight back home and we can still fly out of Rome
* We heard the food is better in Florence

Cons:

* Venice to me seems so much prettier than Florence
* Florence is bigger and seems to have more things to do, which we won't be able to do all in 2 days. I'm sure we can fit in a few highlights but will it be worth going there for 2 days?

Being experienced travellers in Europe, I didn't think anything of buying tickets to attractions over a month in advance. Boy did I screw that up and I feel over my head. 

 It seems all official tickets are gobbled up in seconds and tourists have to deal with 3rd party sites. All of which seems to be shady and illegitimate with horrible reviews if you search the web. 

I am currently looking at the Rome Digital Tourist Card https://www.tiqets.com/en/rome-attractions-c71631/rome-tourist-card-p1013153

While they say their is availability on our date and I can select times for entry into sights, it almost seems too good to be true after looking around and trying to get individual tickets.  

Is this a legitimate offering or is it a scam? Are there any reputable third party sights to get tickets? I have seen some aggregators like getyourguide and viator but those seem even more like a roll of the dice. 


We are looking at the big attractions (Pantheon, Collesium, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill) + maybe the Vatican. 

Any insight or help that is recent is greatly appreciated.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all,

**Firstly, special thanks to the reddit community for providing a lot of really excellent suggestions over the years, without which this compiled list wouldn't exist.** **This post is a small gesture to give back to the reddit community, and hopefully help others in the same situation.**

I often see posts looking for authentic or off the beaten track kind of recommendations for sightseeing in Rome. I'm planning a trip to Italy in December/January. I've been to Rome once before, and I loved it. I did the usual touristy stuff like Pantheon, Colosseum, but they were absolutely, absolutely packed (we went in summer, so the crowds were crazy). On our second trip, it will be winter (so hopefully less tourists), but we also want to see some lesser known sites. This is how after many hours of trawling various forums reddit, youtube, people's own blogs, etc I've managed to compile a list of Ancient Roman sites that we plan to see on our trip this year, and I thought it might be useful for others out there.

You typically see the same places come up a lot, Ostia Antica, Hadrian's Villa, some of them are rarely mentioned which surprises me once you see how breathtaking they are (these ones include, Aurea Domea, Mausoleum of Augustus, etc). The list is **obviously focused on Ancient Roman sites but is very likely missing a bunch of sites** (I'm only human), s**o please feel free to comment and offer any additional recommendations.** I've included info on:

* **whether it's in Rome or how far away it is if not** **(for many of these places outside Roman you can book excellent tours that will take you out there, recommend trip adviser or get your guide)**
* **a brief description of what each site originally was**, or its function, and
* **what's particularly special about that site.**

Not sure what you're primarily interested in, but personally I am really obsessed with Ancient Rome. I am going in December this year and have done quite a bit of research to compile a list of slightly off the beaten track places that you might find helpful (if you're interested in that sorta thing). Thanks to the reddit community as well, for providing a lot of really excellent suggestions - this is a compilation of many reddit threads on the topic. You typically see the same places come up a lot, Ostia Antica, Hadrian's Villa, some of them are rarely mentioned which surprises me once you see how breathtaking they are (these ones include, Aurea Domea, Mausoleum of Augustus, etc). Anyway here they are, I have also included a brief description of what they are and what is unique about them. See below.

**Ostia Antica (Ancient Rome’s main port)**

* **Distance from Rome**: 30 km (40-minute drive) – you can also book a tour online. I recommend Trip Adviser or Get your Guide. 
* **Ancient Use**: Ostia Antica was Rome's primary seaport during the Republic and early Empire. It served as a vital commercial hub for importing goods, especially grain, to feed the growing population of Rome.
* **Special Feature**: Today, it is a well-preserved archaeological site with impressive ruins, including baths, temples, and an amphitheatre, showcasing everyday Roman life.

**Hadrian's Villa (Villa Adriana)**

* **Distance from Rome**: 30 km (40-minute drive). As above – if you don’t have a car, you can book a tour.
* **Ancient Use**: Built by Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD, this massive complex served as his imperial retreat and symbolised the emperor’s wealth and power. It drew inspiration from various parts of the empire.
* **Special Feature**: The site features extensive remains of palaces, gardens, baths, and libraries, reflecting Hadrian's love for architecture and Greek culture.

**Domus Aurea (also known as Nero’s Golden House)**

* **Distance from Rome**: Located in the city – this is walkable.
* **Ancient Use**: The Domus Aurea (""Golden House"") was Emperor Nero’s vast palace complex built after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. It symbolized his extravagant reign and was later buried by his successors to erase his memory.
* **Special Feature**: Known for its opulence, it had vast gardens, artificial lakes, and gold-covered walls, representing the height of imperial luxury.

**Saint Clemente Basilica (Basilica di San Clemente)**

* **Distance from Rome**: Located in the city.
* **Ancient Use**: Originally, a Roman villa with a temple to Mithras stood here, which was later transformed into a Christian basilica in the 4th century.
* **Special Feature**: The basilica is notable for its layers of history, with remains of ancient Roman structures and a Mithraeum below the current church.

**Mausoleum of Augustus**

* **Distance from Rome**: Located in the city – this has just been recently opened
* **Ancient Use**: This circular tomb was built by Emperor Augustus in 28 BC for himself and his family, marking the first of many imperial mausoleums.
* **Special Feature**: Once the largest mausoleum in the Roman world, it symbolized Augustus' power and the transition from Republic to Empire.

**Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace)**

* **Distance from Rome**: Located in the city – this is incredibly beautiful - [https://treasuresofrome.it/wp-content/uploads/slider/cache/9ff0496a5915e0449746b9b5aadd8666/ara\_pacis.webp](https://treasuresofrome.it/wp-content/uploads/slider/cache/9ff0496a5915e0449746b9b5aadd8666/ara_pacis.webp) picture here.
* **Ancient Use**: Commissioned by Emperor Augustus in 13 BC to commemorate his return from successful campaigns in Gaul and Spain, the Ara Pacis was an altar dedicated to Pax, the Roman goddess of peace. It symbolized the peace and prosperity brought by Augustus' rule.
* **Special Feature**: Known for its elaborate reliefs depicting mythological and historical scenes, the altar is a masterpiece of Roman art, showcasing Augustus' vision of the Pax Romana, a long period of relative peace across the empire.

**Appian Way (Via Appia)**

* **Distance from Rome**: Begins in the city – you can hire ebikes to bike the road, or even go on a tour. Once again I recommend trip adviser.
* **Ancient Use**: One of the oldest and most important Roman roads, built in 312 BC to connect Rome with southern Italy, facilitating military and trade movement.
* **Special Feature**: Lined with tombs and monuments, the road was also key for the movement of Roman legions and supplies during the Republic and Empire.

**Aventine Keyhole (Knights of Malta Keyhole)**

* **Distance from Rome**: Located in the city – this apparently is one of the most amazing places to take a photo of Rome. If you want more details I can explain how to get here.
* **Ancient Use**: While the keyhole is a much more recent feature, the Aventine Hill itself has ancient significance as one of Rome’s original seven hills, associated with plebeian settlements and religious rituals.
* **Special Feature**: The keyhole frames a perfect view of St. Peter’s Basilica, but historically, the Aventine Hill was home to temples and early Christian communities.

ItalyTravel,"Just got back from 10 days in Italy. We went for a wedding in Tuscany, and flew in and out of Rome. When booking stays, I just wanted two nights on the coast somewhere near Tuscany and I feel like I found a hidden gem in Genoa (not that it isn't popular but you see way more people talk about Naples, Amalfi or Cinque Terre). We were there over Aug. 15 which is an Italian holiday so it seemed like there were a ton of Italians vacationing there so maybe it's more popular with the locals. 
Anyways we drove from Tuscany and the drive itself was beautiful. We stayed in the Nervi neighborhood and it was somehow even more beautiful. We stayed right on this awesome boardwalk that takes you to restaurants and definitely seems like the a late night hangout area as well. You can train from Nervi to downtown Genoa which we did to hop on a ferry to Portofino. Also highly recommend that. Downtown genoa did seem a little too crowded in areas but I wish we had more time to check out more if the city. On our way out of Nervi we did stop to see friends staying in Monterosso (part of Cinque Terre). 
We came in with little expectations and we're honestly speechless at times with how beautiful it was. I just wanted to come in here sing Genoas praises ",t2_n0a0hj8rk,Here to express my love for Genoa ,0.9,33,1725739015.0,1725739015.0,19,Master-Site2942,1fbfokb

ItalyTravel,"My husband and I are going to Italy (for 12 days) for the first time this Summer (end of August to early September). We started planning and decided we want to spend half our time in Rome and the other half in Florence. During our time in Florence, we will also do 3 day-trips (by train) to Bologna, Lucca, and Siena.

I have some friends who are from Italy and other friends who have been multiple times and I am getting mixed reviews about where to go and how to spend our time there. My friends that are from Italy are saying I should spend more time in the less touristy areas and spend most of our time in the South, my friends who have gone to Italy have been stressing the importance of doing the ""touristy"" things first (eg. colosseum, trevi fountain, museums...etc.) and then coming back on another trip to get to know more parts of Italy. I feel torn because I want to do both, so we are trying our best to sprinkle in a little of both. We would love some advice on this if you've been before!

That being said, what are some must-sees / must-dos in Florence and Rome, and what are some tourist traps that aren't worth going to? We want to experience the history and beauty of Italy, and we are also huge foodies. Any recommendations for museums, restaurants, and activities (eg. cooking classes, excursions...etc.) are much appreciated. If it's helpful to know, our budget is flexible.

ItalyTravel,"So I was on a regional trenitalia train, and I had bought my ticket through the trenitalia website, and i screenshotted it. During the ride, the inspector told me in a very mean way that the ticket wasn't valid because I didn't ""check in"", without giving me much information, and fined me €90.

I tried to ask him what the ""check in"" is, and how I was supposed to do that, but his broken english and his very little tolerance didn't let me really understand what was going on.

Can somebody explain to me what I was supposed to do? I took many regional trains in Italy in the past and I never had issues with inspectors. This was very frustrating, as l'm a very careful person and I always triple check that everything is alright.

ItalyTravel,"I’m from Australia and my Mum and I took a trip together. Mum is 78 and I am 52. We started in Milan which we both didn’t have high expectations of and we both loved it. Then we hired a car and spent a week staying in Stresa on Lake Maggiore, we took day trips to Omegna on Lake Orta, Lake Como and we did trips on Lake Maggiore to Isola de Superiore and Baveno, Laveno and Isola Bella. Then drove to Tirane and took the Bernina Express, then Lake Iseo to Brescia. Then Lake Garda and to Bologna. Then Florence, which we loved. Then Spoleto, a quick side trip to Rasiglia which was an unexpected gem. Then Pescara, Campobasso, which was the only place to have free parking and then on to Bari and an overnight ferry to Tirana. The ferry was a massive disappointment as we booked a suite and they changed the ship so we had a tiny four bunk cabin, there was no wifi, no tv, the room was hot and the restaurant was non existent . Had an amazing time apart from that.Great food, great people. Everyone was so nice and pretty much everyone helped Mum with her bag at all stages of the trip.

ItalyTravel,"We just spend 10 days Easter holiday with the kids (12 & 10) in these three cities.

Flying from Berlin to Pisa, return flight from Rome Fiumicino.

Here are my learnings from the holiday

Public transport:  
- Highly recommend train travel between the cities, booked a few weeks ahead with Trenitalia; super cheap, on time, fast and clean  
- we waited a lot for buses in Florence and Rome, but if you expect this, its a good way to slow down the pace in the busy cities ;-)  
- we downloaded the public transport apps to buy the bus tickets online. TicketAppy for Rome. We never used more than three 1.50€ tickets each day.

Accomondation:  
- We stayed in apartments close to the center and train stations in each city and were always happy. I never saw any hotels on offer that had similar affordable prices for 4 people.

Pisa:  
- Of course its crazy around the tower, but we had a lot of fun ""doing"" the photo shoot and enjoying the whole area around Piazza dei Miracoli.  
- But the best part was wandering around the center directly north and south of the Arno. Relaxed, small, walkable, not touristy, nice ice cream and (student) cafes.  
- We all really liked Art Burger next to Keith Haring's Tuttomondo.

Florence:  
- We were lucky to experience the Easter mass inside the Dome. But the city was just too full and crowded at the Easter weekend.  
- One could hardy walk over Ponte Vecchio, so may many people.  
- We didn't plan on going into any of the museums with the kids as it is already a lot to take in just marveling at the buildings from the outside.  
- Being there we would have loved to climb the tower of Palazzo Vecchio for the beautiful view, but it was sold out.   
- Walking up to Piazzale Michelangelo for the sunset was fun for the kids too!  
- By change we went into Boboli Garden as we continued on Via Romana and came across another entry without a queue. Very chilled after the busy street of thee center.  
- At home before the trip we already saw the hype videos for All'Antico Vinaio and had a good laugh about all the people queuing for sandwiches.But then there was another branch in the station and we got some with a long wait for the train ride to Rome, Real tasty ;-)

Rome:  
- Similar to Florence we focused on walking around, enjoying gelato and see the sides from the outside!  
- We only booked regular Colosseum tickets online, no problem three weeks ahead. But no chance for attic or arena tickets. Yes, just buy adult tickets and get free kids tickets inside after the first ticket check.  
- We went into Pantheon as there was no line when paying cash.  
- Most fun and highlight for all of us was cycling through the park. Even without kids I would recommend to rent an electric pedal car in Borghese Gardens. Beautiful scenery in the parc and great view!  
- The line for St Peters dome was crazy long, we did not go, but it seemed to move fast.   
  
Food recommendations: Fassi Gelateria, Pizzeria Formula 1 & GRANGEL Granite & Gelati Roma in San Lorenzo (liked the student area for food and drinks) and Osteria La Sol Fa (perfect Carbonara) - all of these were close to our apartment...

Ostia  
- We spend a night in Lido di Ostia before the flight.  
A few sunny hours at the beach; it was still off season, but the kids really needed some fun time in the sand and even jumped in the water.  
- We even went to Ostia Antica and that was the best decision as it was so empty, fantastic sight, fun to run freely around the ruins. Highly recommended if you want to be without the crowds.

Fun facts  
- As a film buff I prepared us by watching not only Youtube best of videos, but with Gladiator and my 12 year old daughter adored Love & Gelato and even enjoyed the Wood Allen Rome film ;-)  
- As all apartments had Netflix we did watch Angels & Demons and Inferno when we were in Rome. The kids would normally never enjoy this kind of movies but they had a blast to see the inside of the Vatican on screen and recognize the sights.

- Also very much recommended to all parents to have some dinners and breakfasts alone while the kids enjoy their ""screen time"" in the apartment ;-) The food, wine, drinks and coffee and pistaicho cornettos are just too good!",t2_8w59yxoi9,"Feedback on family trip to Pisa, Florence and Rome plus Ostia",0.92,33,1712608821.0,1712608821.0,5,A1-10T,1bz8r93

ItalyTravel,"An epic workacation. Was really two separate two week vacations - as my GF accompanies first half and two friends the second.

Thanks for Redditers for pre-trip guidance and ideas!

Main points

Renting a car was an excellent decision. There's no way that our trip could have been done without. I was on the fence after asking the pros and cons. I experienced none of the cons.

Having home-base airbnb for month worked well. Mine was in Marina di Pietrasanta.

Traveling with friends requires compromise but having them to share the experience made it epic. None of them had ever been to continental Europe before.

We had no encounters with police or pickpockets or beggars.

September was an excellent travel month this year. Temps ranged from 55 to 85. Very pleasant. Rained about 1 out of 5 days but was only heavy late at night. During day it would just drizzle for 10-15 mins and then clear up.

Public transportation was prompt, efficient, and a nice experience. Parking and tram into Florence from Parcheggio Villa Costanza worked really well. The parking lot has its own tollbooths. Parking for a month was €40.

Lucca is still one of my favorite places. This time I got to experience it at night on one visit. Went to bar in Piazza Antelminelli after our wine tasting at Fattoria Al Dotto Lucca (an excellent Redditor recommendation) where hundreds of local young adults come to socialize.

Venice exceeded all expectations. Was my first time there. No amount of research could prepare me for the in-person experience. We would get lost within a minute - and it was a blast.

Drive south from Bellagio towards Malpensa was like a video game - with consequences for mistakes.

Marina di Pietrasanta beaches were very nice but Viareggio was better for swimming since water didn't have dead kelp in the water near shore.

Glad that GF and I stopped in Ravenna to see the mosaics on the way to Venice. Yeah, not really on the way - but it was when we had to go. I'm a fan of Byzantine history.

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone,

I just got back from a trip to Italy and wanted to share a little recommendation regarding eSIMs. I used it (got Saily eSIM) for the first time while I was there.

Before I left, I was a bit stressed about my phone situation because I didn’t wish to pay crazy international fees from my US provider. After some research, I saw Saily eSIM being mentioned a lot recently on Reddit. I also saw them rank high up in this comparison too: [https://www.reddit.com/r/best\_eSIM\_providers/comments/1984tvl/best\_esim\_providers\_comparison\_table\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/best_eSIM_providers/comments/1984tvl/best_esim_providers_comparison_table_for/)

A week before my flight, I purchased it online (5GB) and used their discount sailydata15, making the plan even cheaper ($11.04 instead of $12.99). The set up was pretty clear, they gave me a QR code, which I scanned with my iPhone 13 Pro. To my surprise, the whole setup process took just a few minutes. I was a bit skeptical at first – it almost seemed too easy to work.

Fast-forward to my arrival in Rome. The second I landed, my phone connected to a local network without any issues. It was a relief not to have to go around looking for a SIM card vendor at the airport.

Throughout my two-week holiday, I always had a strong signal and fast data (seemed like they have premium network providers). I was constantly sharing photos, looking up restaurant reviews, and navigating with ease. There wasn’t a single moment where I was disconnected.

Looking back, choosing an eSIM was a smart decision. It was affordable, easy to set up, and worked perfectly throughout my stay. If you're planning a trip to Italy and know that you’ll use the internet to look up things or even use basic maps, I recommend doing the same.",t2_74px1s77,Best eSIM for Italy recommendation,0.78,28,1716447910.0,1716447910.0,31,QuiteAllRight1,1cymplm

Hello lovely travelers and people of Reddit! 

For the past few years of my Reddit life, I have seen that many questions regarding aspects of travelling in Italy get repeated periodically, so I’ve decided to try and make some *IFAQs [Italy Frequently Asked Questions]* posts, hoping to help anyone who might be searching for useful information for their upcoming journey in our beautiful country. 
This is the first post of my project, and it’s about **Italian Motorways**, hopefully if it is appreciated I will be doing more in the near future. 


If you find this useful or helpful, and would like to offer me a coffee, it would be highly appreciated, and you can do so [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hopeiwasuseful).  
If not, no worries! I will be happy to offer you one myself if by chance we meet during your stay! Peace!

#**ITALIAN MOTORWAYS**  
(Or ITALIAN HIGHWAYS, as some might call them)

(Last update: March2024)  
  
Italian motorways (or highways, as some would call them) work via a toll system. The price you pay to use the motorway depends on the distance covered. You only pay at the exit.

##*Prices:*   
   
Prices depend on the type of road and “class of vehicle”. For a classic car, the prices (as of 2024) should be approximately:  
- 0.072 €/km on flat roads;  
- 0.085 €/km on mountain roads.  
  
Prices can be higher for certain parts of the motorway, due to the fact that some stretches are managed by different private companies.

##*Gates:*   
 
On entering the motorway, you will (nearly always) find two types of gates:   
 
- BIGLIETTO: as a tourist, this is the only one you are interested in. You will have to stop next to the automatic machine and pick up a ticket (sometimes you will have to press the button to have it printed). Once you pick up the ticket, the barrier will lift and you may access the motorway;  
- TELEPASS: easily recognisable thanks to the bright yellow signs and paint on the road. As a tourist, you must avoid this gate (even if the barrier is lifted), unless you have a Telepass subscription. 
  
On exiting the motorway, you will find three main types of gates, each with a different symbol:  
  
- CASH SYMBOL: go through this gate if you intend to pay by cash. If next to the cash symbol there is also the symbol of a HAND, then the gate will be manned and you will interact with a person. If there isn’t such symbol (like in the majority of cases), the gate will have an automatic machine. Once you insert (or give the operator) your entrance ticket, the price you have to pay will appear on the display. Once you have paid (and collected your change), the barrier will open and you can exit.  
- CARTE: Blue sign and blue lines on the road. Go through this gate if you intend to pay by card. There will be an automatic machine in which you insert your ticket, followed by the card. It will probably “talk” to you giving you instructions (in Italian). It should be possible (but maybe not yet everywhere) to pay also contactless.   
 - Riservato clienti TELEPASS: yellow sign and yellow lines on the road. Do not use this gate (unless you have a telepass subscription and used the telepass gate also when entering).   
  
If, for any reason, you end up at the wrong gate, DO NOT reverse gear and move backwards. It is dangerous and also illegal and can get you fined.  Instead, push the button to talk to an operator and describe your situation. They will probably open the barrier for you and instruct you on how to make the payment. 
  
##*Speed Limit:*   

Speed limit on Italian motorways, if not otherwise indicated, is of 130 km/h. It is usually monitored by a Safety Tutor System, that detects your average speed (not your instantaneous speed), although you can still find some classic speed cameras. In some areas it can be lower, but will in that case it will be clearly indicated.   
 

##*Rest areas:*   

Along Italian motorways you will often find petrol/gas stations (with prices much higher than normal), with usually a small service building and rest area built next to them. The most famous type of motorway service is the “Autogrill”, name by which, in common spoken Italian, all of the motorway food stops go by. In the Autogrill you can find a snack bar, sometimes a self service restaurant, toilets, and a mini supermarket with a focus on local food and wine products. Just like for petrol, all prices in autogrill are higher than normal.

ItalyTravel,"TLDR:
GetYourGuide cancelled our booking 24 hours in advance and after stating 5-10 business day refund, has yet to provide a refund over a month later. 

Story:
For our trip in early October, I booked Borghese Garden skip the line tickets from GetYourGuide. Once booked, my wife mentioned that she had seen some reviews of people unsatisfied with their tickets or tickets getting cancelled. We decided to risk it anyway since the reviews on the website were all very high. 

Since it was our first stop on our trip, we received an email from GetYourGuide just before we got on the plane in Toronto that our tickets were cancelled and that we should cancel ourselves through the app to get the easiest refund. At this point we figured what's the worst that can happen. If we get there and there really is no tickets, we will do something else. Maybe someone else won't show up and we can take their 2 tickets or something. We knew it was too late to book or change anything so we didnt bother. 

We arrive and of course there is no GetYourGuide anywhere. There were at least 3 other companies around distributing tickets to their patrons but no GetYourGuide. We ended up waiting in line for about 2 hours to get in which we didn't mind since we were on the plane all day and the museum was beautiful  And totally worth it. 

While waiting in line. I messaged GetYourGuide on whatsapp asking for the refund which they stated would be 5-10 buisness days. Fast forward over a month and we still have yet to receive a refund. I will be starting the chargback process this afternoon. 

This is our experience with them which is absolutely a 1 star experience but I don't think that putting this review on their website will really provide much benefit since I get the feeling that the website reviews might be a bit biased in their benefit and our detriment. Hopefully I can help someone out there prevent this from hapenning on a tour that their trip revolves around. We are lucky this was only a minor inconvenience for us and the only tour we booked through GetYourGuide.

ItalyTravel,"Hi! Just want to let you guys know how my trip went.


Two weeks ago I went solo travelling for the first time and spent 6 days in Italy. I loved it and never felt unsafe - I always kept my bag close to me at all times, but even walking around and such was so easy and nice. 


I spent basically three days in Pisa, but went to Spezia for a full day and got a boat ride through the Cinque Terre, having still some time to go for a swim in Monterosso. Also had a ""great"" experience and got caught by a storm while waiting for the boat in Vernazza and on the ride back! It was somewhat fun.


After that, took a train to Torino and spent three days there. So much to see in such little time, and loved the city! It didn't feel very touristy, which I really appreciated.


I tried to do everything on a somewhat tight budget and was able to. Stayed in very central hostels, but really not expensive (in Pisa it was right behind the tower, basically). 


So, in case anyone is wondering if they should do it, just go ahead and DO IT! 


Met some amazing people in my journey, even had a stranger showing me around! They also bought me a small cake, and made me celebrate my birthday with a view of Torino! 


I hope I can soon return and do a similar journey. Thank you so much, Italy!


P.S.: I'm a young woman, in case security issues might come up.

ItalyTravel,"It is nice to see some positive posts from people that had a good time in Italy without negative experiences. Even though they often look like meme posts, because at this point it became such an expectation that traveling is dangerous, they are important. I am sure that the people having bad experiences are the loud minority. The same phenomenon with restaurant reviews where people that had a bad experience are more likely to leave a review.
I am not condemning the people that post bad experiences, but everyone browsing this sub should be aware of this.

ItalyTravel,"I still have a couple days left into my solo vacation and but I wanted to reflect on how much fun I've had (although I'm homesick haha).

1) I booked to do a half Alta Via 1 but ended cutting it 2 days short because I knew my body couldn't take it. Please go easy on me on this... I definitely was too overconfident and underestimated the mountains. I left with a pretty bad sunburn, multiple blisters, minor bruises and a bruised ego. BUT I had a lot of fun enjoying the view and meeting new people in the rifugios. Also to all the local hikers cheering me on saying ""2 more hours!"" ""Brava!"" ""100 more metres!"" it really helped push me. I met a lot of international hikers, too. It's just been a great experience and I hope to try it again (but better prepared).

2) Everyone was so friendly and kind! Even if they didn't speak english, hand gestures and google translate went a long way. During my stay in Rif Nuvolau, I was pretty worn out and sat alone and I also skipped dessert, the workers there tried to encourage me to sit with a bigger table and chat and encouraged me to eat more 🥺. Also... I know I hate to bring ""race"" into this because I too was freaked out about it and reddit had a bunch of posts post-covid about being treated differently as east-asian (im Chinese, born in Canada)... but like I had no problems (not to discount other's experience). But when people asked where I was from, no asked ""but where are you really from?"" which I get a lot in Canada. Nah, here, they just say ""Aaah Canada! So cold!""

3) Food was great! I was basic... definitley got carbonara... and caccio e pepe first (I wanted to see how it tasted so I could recreate it). I had SO MUCH COFFEE and GELATO! Real pistaccio gelato all the way! The rustic food inside the rifugios were great too, I took pictures so I can recreate them.

4) Why is everyone so fashionable... I wish I brought more vacation clothes, but yeah I was definitely jealous of everyone's cute clothes and I'm here... a scrub haha.

**only uncomfortable thing was a waitor was way too handsy... I know some cultures are more physically affectionate but it was too much. 

Anyways, excited to come back and tackle the Dolomites and explore more thank you for having me and treating me so well! And thank you to this sub reddit for answering my questions on my sunburn. I definitely suffered and learned my lesson to not fuck around with the sun 😂",t2_10g1exan,Humbled by the Dolomites but ready to try again!,0.85,30,1719303055.0,1719303055.0,53,chouhone,1do0sa6
ItalyTravel,"Hey guys, I spent a lot of time in this sub in preparation for my trip and got some great advice so I wanted to pass along my experience. (2 travellers, mid 30s)

Day 1: Landed at FCO and took the Leonardo Express to Roma Termini, then immediately hopped on Frecciarossa to Florence. Walked from Santa Maria Novella station to our airbnb near Uffizi Gallery (20 minutes) Grabbed a sandwich and some beers from All’Antica Vinaio and headed up to our airbnb to eat and rest.

Day 2: Woke up at 7am and took a walk around Ponte Veccio, Santo Spirito and up to the Duomo area. Very different experience than the night before, much less crowded and more pleasant to walk about. On the advice of our airbnb host we visited Giardino Bardini as a slightly less touristy alternative to Boboli. It was free and we really enjoyed the flowers and the gorgeous view of the city. After lots of walking and the sun getting much hotter, we went back to the airbnb for a quick rest/cooldown. Finished the day with more exploring and dinner. 

Day 3: We slept in a bit and then went for coffee and pastry before our 10am slot at Uffizi that I purchased months in advance. We’re not huge art enthusiasts but it was absolutely worth going. Very crowded, would recommend booking as early of a time as possible. We brought our airpods and used the guide in the Rick Steves app and it made our experience a lot more interesting. We ended up walking over to Santo Spirito to Gustapizza for lunch and got takeaway as the line was very long to sit. (Nice pizza but nothing too special). Dinner that night was at La Buchetta which I had reserved ahead of time because it was close to our airbnb. Touristy place, American waiter, however a comfortable space with a nice vibe and good food. 

Day 4: Walked to our rental car agency (Tuscany by car) and picked up our vehicle and made it out of the city (nervously attempting to avoid ZTL). Stopped for a quick glass of wine at Antinori 20 minutes south, picked up a couple bottles for the next leg of our trip. Continued to Siena and stocked up on groceries at the Co-op store on the north end. Very nice modern grocery store, ample free parking. Finally arrived at our direct booked bnb 20 min east of Siena called Pieve Marsina & Borgo Argenina. This place was heaven. Honestly wished we could’ve spent way more time there. A lot more our pace than the hustle and bustle of the city. 

Days 5-8: Day trips from our bnb to wineries (HIGHLY recommend the lunch tasting at Poggio Amorelli), Drove the Chiantigiana SR222 (very fun driving scenic winding roads), Spent a wonderful afternoon in Siena, took a drive down through the Val D’Orcia (absolutely stunning) to Montepulciano and Montalcino. Did a wonderful cooking class at our bnb our final night. Returned the car in Florence and took the train back to Rome. 

Day 9: The previous night we checked into our airbnb in Trastevere which was really a great vibe. Live music and entertainment in the piazza, crowded but felt safe and carefree almost like a music festival. You’re allowed to drink in public (supposedly before 10pm). We walked around the colosseum area and it was cool to see but very crowded and a little bit dampened by the presence of the migrant scammers from Africa. “Nice shoes! Where you from?” Do not fistbump, do not engage, politely wave them off. We had an outstanding lunch at Trattoria Da Enzo, we arrived 30 minutes before opening and were 12th in line and got in right away. By opening time a long line formed down the block. We ended up just walking around Trastevere eating various street foods all evening and watched the musicians again. 

Day 10: Taxi to airport, our airbnb host set it up and it was a 50 euro flat fee. 

Tips: 

-Purchase an esim if your phone is compatible. I used Airalo and it was easy to set up and vastly cheaper than using my own provider’s roaming plan. 5gb of data was $12 and after 10 days of regular usage for maps/spotify/insta/email I had 2gb left

-Purchase Frecciarossa tickets well in advance for a lower price. Make sure you buy tickets you can modify in case of a flight delay. I left 3 hours between flight arrival time and Florence train, we had over an hour to kill at Roma Termini which we spent eating lunch in the central market inside the terminal. Your platform will not be on the board until less than 10 minutes before departure. Our train we labelled as “Milano” as that was the FINAL destination (look for the train number on your ticket i.e, Frecciarossa 9415)

-Purchase your Leo Express tickets online once you land, or purchase from the counter inside the small cafe near the station entrance. There are very few ticket machines with very long lines with poor signage for alternatives. 

-The cobblestone streets of Florence make travelling with roller suitcases very difficult, do-able but not easy. 

-Always be aware of your surroundings and keep hands on your wallet/phone. Watch out for pickpocket crews (many of them African migrants). Even in Trastevere they were easy to spot, they work in groups and are often pretty obvious about it.

ItalyTravel,"Just got back from 2 weeks in Italy! Spent the last few days in Rome. We stayed at an Airbnb overlooking the Foro Traiano and there were a lot of people around the area of selling things, etc. but the most aggressive one was this man dressed as a pirate (not even sure what a pirate has to do with Rome…). Has anyone seen him in this area?? He was so aggressive in taking photos with people, would literally GRAB people for photos, put his pirate hat on their head and then demand money from them. We sat on our balcony and just watched him circle around and around like a shark, getting family after family. 

So if anyone is in this area, beware the man dressed like the pirate!! Just ignore him completely or he will aggressively grab you for a photo and then charge you for it.

My girlfriend and me are currently travelling through beautiful Tuscany and are totally confused by the ginormous portions that are served here at restaurants. We both like to eat - probably more than is good for us - and still we are totaly overwhelmed by the portions that are served here.

We like to have multiple courses but for the second time it now already happened to us that the first course is bigger than what we would consider a regular portion, followed by a main course that would be big enough to be shared among 2-3 people.

Do Italians really eat that much? Or is it some cultural thing to always serve more than people could possibly eat? Or do we understand something wrong about the meaning of first course and main course?",t2_c8jcv4m6,Restaurant Portion Sizes,0.79,29,1724357763.0,1724357763.0,74,3vil5hit,1eytdmr
ItalyTravel,"Long Post. Thought I'd make my first ever post on this site after our wonderful trip to North Italy. First thing I want to mention is at no point and time did we feel unsafe or uneasy in any location we were in. The worst interactions we had was with some grumpy lady serving us gelato in Monterosso and 6 rose peddlers approaching us at a bar within 5 minutes of each other. I'll share what we did and where we stayed and ate. On our holiday's, we typically splurge on restaurant experiences and are frugal with hotels/Airbnbs, we are huge walkers and usually cover \~15 miles in a day on average. We don't do tour groups (unless needed or advised to) and (try) to avoid touristy shops/restaurants. We aren't huge shoppers but do tend to buy stuff from local artists or shops if something catches our eye. We rented a car for the entirety of the trip which I cannot stress enough how good of a decision that was. I'm happy to answer any questions or tips we can offer based on our experiences.

Milan (2 nights) 

Stayed at the UNAHOTEL Scandanavia near Chinatown which was mostly pretty bleh. We spent the first day downshifting from our flight and walked from the hotel to the Navigli neighborhood and walked around the canals. We had a few (excellent) cocktails at Mag Cafe before having an awesome dinner at 28 Posti. 

Next day we spent walking around the rest of the city with stops at the Duomo. This thing is an absolute must see if you are here and I highly recommend doing the fast track pass. After the Duomo, we hiked it up toward lunch at Osteria Brunello. On the way, my wife was stopping by some shops looking to buy a hat as she forgot hers. We wound up in a tiny boutique where she pointed out one on a display that she liked, to which the owner said it's not for sale because it's only for the display. She tells us to wait and then proceeds to go to the back and brings out another hat that she insists my wife have as a gift from her! I insisted on giving her some cash and she continued to refuse. We tried to buy something in the shop but she said her system was shutdown for the afternoon break. Insane that this actually happen! I wish I noted the store. Also, we hated the main shopping area/mall. We found the galleries and shops in the neighborhoods north of there to be far more inviting and attractive. Lunch at OB was excellent.. we shared a Milanese risotto and a cotoletta and as you could probably guess, a good amount of brunello wine. For dinner, we drove up to Brusaporto for dinner at Da Vittorio. This was easily the best meal of our trip and possibly one of the best we'd ever had.

-

Cinque Terre (1 night)

Would have loved to have one more night at least here. Drove straight down and stayed at the Hotel Palme in Monterosso where we were able to park and do an early check-in. Hotel was fine for what it was. The staff and owner were absolutely wonderful though. Took the ferry from Monterosso to Riomaggiore (definitely do this for some amazing views of the towns) and had lunch at a pizza shop that I won't mention because it wasn't so great. After stuffing our face with two whole pies, we he hiked it to Manarola. Not a wise lunch choice but we made it nonetheless. Encountered multiple people along the way who claimed this was by far the hardest leg of the hikes between the towns. Walked a bit around Manarola until the crowds became a bit much, so we took the train back to Monterosso. We had some spritzes (Barabba in White) and hung out at the public beach before cleaning up and going out for a late dinner. We ate at L'ancora della Tortuga. Think we had the best seat in the house as we had our own table tucked away at the top of the hill overlooking the sea and cliffs. Food was unfortunately very hit and miss. Big hit though, and to our surprise, we stopping by Gelateria Fegina for what would up being our favorite gelato of the entire trip. 

-

Tuscany (4 nights)

En route to our agriturismo, we stopped in Pisa to check out the tower and the surrounding buildings. Tower was fun and heading up it; the lean was very much felt. We had lunch at Erbaluigia which most everything we had was delicious. Pigeon 4-ways was awesome. We then drove to Podere Felceto (near Panzano) to check-in. I cannot say enough how amazing the family that runs this place is. Mom, dad and two daughters make this already beautiful place even more amazing. They are olive farmers and the grounds are nothing short of breathtaking. They are Buddhists and in the cold months of the year, they close for tourists and house practicing Buddhists from around the world. We spent our afternoon after check-in poolside. For a late dinner, we went to Osteria di Passignano. Wife hated it, I thought it was generally pretty good. The wine list is one of the best we encountered on our trip.

The next day with did a 2-town hop starting bright and early with Siena. We learned pretty quickly that the best way to enjoy a place is to arrive really early to beat the crowds. Once noon hits, the hoards of people are everywhere. Siena was beautiful and a must see if you are in Tuscany. We had lunch at probably my favorite restaurant of the trip outside Da Vittorio; Ristorante Campo Cedro. The shop is run by a Japanese chef who offers modern takes on Italian cuisine while incorporating common Asian ingredients to the dishes. Only mistake we made here is not doing the 7-course tasting. We then drove to San Gimignano; a tiny yet beautiful medieval town NW of Siena. We bought some wines from the region, meats, cheeses and other treats. Made our first Tre Coni stop at Gelateria Dondoli. We had a pretty extensive tasting at Arnolfo just outside SG. The restaurant definitely lived up to its 2\* status. 

Day 3 was mostly spent on tours of two of the major wineries in the area, specializing mostly in Chianti Classico. First we did a tour of Brolio Castle and had a tasting of some Ricasoli wines. We then drove to Antinori and did something similar. While the grounds were stunning and we learned a lot about the history of the regions and wines, we ultimately would have rather spent the day at smaller vineyards. No regrets though and we would up buying a bunch of wine anyway. We did conclude that the Antinori family may be the Dons of the Italian wine world. We had dinner at Dario's in Panzano (Macelleria Cecchini). If one is not familiar with this place, it's served family style and basically all you can eat and drink. We befriended an Italian family on holiday from Lucca which was our favorite part of the evening. 

Day 4 was intended to be a full day in Firenze with a late dinner but wound up being shortened after our hosts informed us they were able to get us a reservation at a small vineyard down the street from them (Vallone di Cecione). We started out really early again by parking and walking across the Ponte Vecchio (which was pleasantly barren).  We were first in line at the Uffizi. We saw many of the key pieces of note and then hiked it to the Academia to see the David. Between the two, we very much preferred the Academia. The David is a marvel and a must see. We loved the ""unfinished"" Michelangelo's and the music part of the museum. Had lunch at Trattoria Mario for a Florentine Steak and Panzanella, both of which were out of this world. Walked around a little more and after the crowds got crazy, we left and headed to the vineyard. I want to note that the core of Florence is incredibly small and easily can be walked from end to end in any direction very quickly. The vineyard tour and tasting was wonderful and we bought a few bottles and some amazing olive oil. Dinner was very average and we were embarrassed we were both unable to eat even half of our pasta dishes (Cinghale Pappardelle and another ragu dish with rabbit). We did see a wild boar on our way back to the hotel, which was fun.

-

Modena (1 night)

We stayed at an Airbnb with (very cheap) street parking just a short 5 minute walk to the town center. This day was mostly penciled around visiting the famous restaurant Osteria Francescana for lunch. It was always on our restaurant bucket list. Well, I wish I had this one back. Not getting into specifics, but it was a huge letdown. The rest of the afternoon and evening were spent walking around town. We loved the vibrant nighttime vibe there. After having some gelato (Bloom), we asked the shop owner for a dinner rec and she suggested a very old and local favorite (Ristorante da Danilo) a few blocks away (that was already on our radar). Our meal was delicious; highly recommend the Tortellini in Brodo and to get some type of antipasto of meats and cheeses. Yes we did pick up some balsamic while meandering. I also want to mention a beer draft house we went to that highlights some craft breweries of North Italy (Birrlandina).

-

Venice (2 nights)

Parked and left our luggage in a storage locker and just grabbed our backpacks for the two days there. We stayed at an interesting place (Ca' Lavezzera) just southwest on the island. It's a relatively quiet street but close to everything. There was tons of free snacks and a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us. We spent the first day grabbing some cicchetti and taking a vaporetto to Murano. For my stupidest purchase of trip, I bought two 2-day passes for the vaporetto, to which we only used twice; to Murano and back again. Loved the island and we bought some jewellery and some drinking glasses from a local artist who's mom couldn't stop praising her son's achievements. Upon our return, we had to wait for 3 vaporettos before finally being able to board bc of the huge line. Ran to our reservation at Osteria alle Testiere. We oddly were sat next to two people who my wife knew from 20+ years ago that lived down the street from her growing up. This was a great night with amazing food, wine, and conversation. The staff and service here was second to none. We bought a bottle of their house-made amaro after sampling it after our meal.

Day two was a very chill. We spent most of it walking all around the island, grazing on chicchetti, drinking spritzes, and taking photos of this magical city. I want to give a shout to a local artist we bought a mask from (The Friends Of Pierrot Ravagnan Giovanna) who does beautiful work. We had yet another delicious seafood-heavy dinner at Al Covo. Not sure why Venice gets a bad rap for food, we loved everything we at here.

-

Dolomites (2 nights)

Stayed at a beautiful B&B called Ristorante Apartments-B&b Pian Schiavaneis, just 10 minutes outside of Canazei. Can't speak to how hard working and kind our host Evalina was. After a long drive we had lunch at the B&B and hunkered down after a long drive. In the evening before dinner, we walked around Canazei for some picturesque views of the town and mountains. We had dinner at La Stüa de Michil, which was one of our favorite meals of the trip. It was one of those situations where you can't possibly fit any more food, but they keep bringing out delicious thing after delicious thing, that you can't stop. Top-notch service staff and atmosphere as well.

For our last day in Italy, we had an amazing breakfast of eggs, meats, and cheeses at the B&B. We then drove and took a cable car to the base camp of Piz Boe and hiked the mountain to the top. After running a marathon pretty much every day this trip, we couldn't have be prouder of ourselves for making it to the summit. Highly recommend doing this if you are in the area, the views are like something out of a fairy tale. On our way back, we stopped at at Rifugio Maria for some very tasty German-y food. After the long day, we decided to hang at the B&B and have dinner there as well. We had pizza, bean soup, and a cabbage salad for dinner and like everything else we ate there, it was fantastic.

  
If you are still here.. thanks! I read so many inspiring reports of posters trips' on here that I wanted to give something back! We made it back unscathed and cannot wait to go back. In retrospect, we would have probably nixed Cinque Terre, Modena and possibly the Dolomites in Liu of doing another day or two in Tuscany (really wanted to visit Montepulciano, Montalcino and more of the southern parts of the region; and possibly a couple of nights in Verona/Lake Garda area. That drive from the Dolomites to Malpensa airport was an absolute m'Fr the next day. Anyhow, happy to answer any questions if anyone has any!

ItalyTravel,"Thought I would share thoughts as I go along from our one-month trip through Italy.  Just finished week 1. This post will cover Rome and follow up post on Tuscany. Feel,free to ask questions. Hope you find it helpful. 

Rome

Landed at FCO. Customs was a non-event.  Met our driver (sent by hotel) and came into town.  About 40 minutes. 

Hotel - Rome Life Hotel.   Nice hotel in a good location.  Edge of Monti neighborhood.  Close to Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi.  We walked most everywhere. Room not huge but very comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful. 

Food - Honestly have not had a bad meal.  

Day 1
Trieste Pizza wonderful for lunch 
Il Girasole for dinner.  Great locals place right near our hotel. 

Day 2
Nonna Betta in Jewish Ghetto for lunch. Outstanding and really good fried artichoke 
Roscioli Salumeria in Campo di Fiori. Fantastic dinner.  Get reservations. 

Day 3
Dar Poeta in Trastavere for pizza for lunch
Celebratory dinner for 60th birthday at Mirabelle in the Splendide Royals Hotel. Amazing.  Pricey but food and service were great.  Started with drinks at the Adele Mixology Lounge on top floor.  Great views.  You need reservations for both. 

Tours
We had a private tour guide for both days and Federica was amazing.  Day one was Colosseum, Roman Forum and surrounding area.  We did the underground in the Colosseum.  Very cool.  Day 2 was Vatican Museum.  Advice is if you can do a private or semi-private tour, then do it.  They know where to go and how to get around the crowds. 

We walked most everywhere except Vatican. Saw most of the sites we wanted.  Just wander and you find things.  

Taxis/Ubers
Used Uber app and worked well.  It will also call taxis for you if you want to go that route.  Ubers tended to accept the ride and then cancel. Annoying. 

Other things 
-Do not engage with street scammers around main attractions.  They are everywhere.  Just ignore them and they will move on.

-Never felt unsafe or uncomfortable walking around but just know your surroundings.  Just like any big city. 

-If you think you will need Euros, get them before you come if possible.  They have Euronet ATMs everywhere but they are a ripoff. And they were the only ATM we saw at the airport.  If needed, find a legit bank and use theirs.  I did find one but it took me a while.

ItalyTravel,"Hi there, 

I wanted to share my experience with 2 things :

* Europcar
* Electric vehicule (EV) in north Italy

With my GF we wanted to do a little roadtrip in north Italy during August during 1 week, and finish it with the palio in Siena.

Our trip : Milan -> Lago di garda -> Venezia -> Belluno -> Bologna -> Siena -> Milan

One of the key point of this trip was to do it with an EV, we wanted to try a Tesla and as a techy guy, enjoy it. So we've rented a Tesla model 3 with Europcar, pricey compared to thermic cars (around 400€ for 6 days) but we were supposed to enjoy the journey.

**1st issue**, we arrived at the front desk of Europcar, the only Tesla is under maintenance... Only dodgy EV cars like MG or Peugeot :( no solution given by Europcar, ""take it or leave it"". So we took the Peugeot e2008, for a similar price because this new rental was made the same day and not in advance. Of course Europcar didn't call us to warn about the Tesla, they didn't give a shit, no excuse. I wrote to their Customer care, they answered 2 (two !) months after saying ""our bad"". They didn't even refund the difference between the first rental and the second one, I had to beg them.

**2nd issue**, the Tesla Supercharger network was enough developed in Italy to rent a Tesla, without this network having an EV would be a nightmare. But now with a Peugeot instead of a Tesla the situation is different. On the first day we tried to charger our car on a public charging network but as expected it was very very slow, thanksfully I remembered that the Superchargers are now open to any EV (at least in Italy) so instead of taking 6h to charge our car, it took us 1h from 10% to 80%.

**3rd issue**, charging price in Supercharger is not the same if you own a Tesla or another EV. For our case it was pricey for our whole roadtrip.

**4th issue**, the car autonomy was different from the Tesla model 3 (500km) and the Peugeot e2008 (around 200km) so we had to change our plan

**5th issue**, the Peugeot e2008 was a shitty car. Stupid integrated computer, no possibility to organize a trip with charging network, no possibility to have AC while the car is charging (you can imagine in august in Italy, in a parking, we couldn't stay in the car because of the heat), low autonomy, SUV...

Of course I don't recommand Europcar (at least if you want to rent the only one Tesla in Malpensa), of course I don't recommand a Peugeot e2008 but if you want to do a trip with an EV have in mind that the Tesla Supercharger network is open to any EV (at least for now)",t2_kuw5x,My experience with an electric car in north Italy (Europcar),0.79,28,1729505348.0,1729505348.0,38,chibrax3000,1g8m52r
ItalyTravel,"Last week, my wife and I spent 5 amazing days in Rome. r/ItalyTravel and r/Rome Reddit groups helped me with planning, and I wanted to share my experiences here with future Rome visitors. Here are some  highlights:

**Landing and Airport**   
  
We arrived at FCO, where immigration turned out to be a bit of a nightmare—about a two-hour wait for those without biometric passports (i.e. for around 140 countries). Depending on the district you stay in, you can choose the regional train or Leonardo Express for airport transfer. Unlike blog recommendations, we found it quicker to take the regional train, as we stayed in Trastevere. Quick note: The ticket validation machines seem to be broken at the airport. We did travel without validation, but it's better to let someone at the station know about this issue before boarding to be safe. I think since the train starts from the airport, they do not bother checking, maybe? 

**Accommodation**  
  
We stayed at B&B Trastevere, a fantastic hotel. Everyone was welcoming and helpful. The room was cleaned daily and was very comfortable, cost-effective and spacious.

**Public transport**  
  
We decided on the B&B Trastevere because it’s next to the tram station and takes you straight to the centre of Rome. But unfortunately, the trams are closed for renovation till the end of the year. Alternate bus services run along the same tram route but aren't on time and can get quite crowded. We took the €24 CIS 7-day pass, which needs validation only once - the first time you use it. Don't forget to write your name and DOB on the card. This was the most convenient thing ever as we never had to tap in or validate anywhere else, which is very difficult to do when it gets crowded on the bus. During the 5 days in Rome, we were asked to show our tickets to the inspector thrice. So, take that ticket and validate it.

**Food**  
  
We tried the famous places only in Rome. Notable mentions below,

* Gelato - Gelateria La Romana - the best we tried!
* Pizza - Pinsa 'mpò near Vatican, Pizza ZaZa - small place, good pizza sold by weight.
* Pasta - Verso Sara, - Amatriciana
* Tiramisu - 2 Sizes Tiramisu - tried both classic and pistachio. Both are good.
* Coffee - Good everywhere; don't forget to try Maritozzi while you are at it
* Sandwich - Pane e Salame - went with their recommendations.
* Street Food - Trapizzino Trastevere - very tourist-friendly and great food

**Tours**  

* Best of Historical Center of Rome by Live Virtual Guide - The owner, Federica itself, took our tour, which was very informative and interactive. She is a great storyteller and knowledgeable.
* Borghese Gallery Tour - Highly recommended to do with a guide. We are not museum people at all. But still, we loved this experience with our Guide Claudia from 'Inside Out Italy'. We got to see Bernini, Caravaggio, and Raphael's works in person, with a guide explaining everything in detail.
* Twilight Trastevere Rome Food Tour - This 4-hour tour we took from Eating Europe. We loved our guide, Carolina, who asked to stay together like an Italian family. Being toxic, lol! The experience was good, and the guide was fun. Since we are alcoholics, we would have liked to have seen a better selection of wine or more local drinks for the tour.
* Colosseum, Palatine Hill and Roman Forum Tour - We went with 'Walks Italy'. Our guide, Michale, was so good. The guides from Walks Italy know their history. The guide had good knowledge and storytelling ability and answered all our questions. I found the visit to the Roman forum more interesting than the Colosseum tour because of how he explained the history.
* Pristine Sistine Early Entrance Small Group Vatican Tour - We went again with 'Walks Italy'. Sev was the best guide we ever had in life. Very knowledgeable and informative. We wanted him to continue even after spending roughly 5 hours with him. This man knows his history and art. He is a highly recommended guide, and if you can choose him, please do. The only downside about the tour is that, even if it says it's early morning and has fewer people, that's not the case. It's a very crowded tour indeed. But we decided to overlook this since the guide was terrific.
* Angels and Demons tour - I read this book around 10 years ago and wanted to visit the places mentioned. Unfortunately, Trenitalia had other plans. They had an infrastructure failure, and the trains never arrived. We ended up missing the tour. We tried to contact the operator to reach the second location of the tour, but they weren't helpful or apologetic about what happened.

ItalyTravel,"Like (seemingly) many others, I was pickpocketed while my gf and I were riding bus 87 from the Colosseum back to our hotel. I was wearing my sidebag on the front, but the bus was quite crowded, and next thing I knew, both of my sidebag's zippers were open and my wallet was gone. (Thankfully, I didn't have our passports on me.)

I spent a few hours cancelling everything + faxing forms (yes, this was the only solution lol) to my state's Secretary of State to get a new driver's license, and never really expected to get anything back. The cards  were replaceable, and I only had \~ €100 in my wallet, but the wallet itself was quite expensive, plus there was a sentimental note in it.

Fast forward two days, and I get a message on LinkedIn of all places from someone saying they found a few of my cards! I was a little weary, but they said they found a few of my cards (drivers licenses + work ID, no credit cards) in a flower pot near the Trevi Fountain. The location they sent me on Google Maps was in a public area, so I figured it wouldn't be risky to check it out, and, lo and behold, the cards were indeed in the flower pot. Didn't get the wallet or note back, but better than nothing! The cashier at the store next door said she noticed those same cards a few days ago as well and tried to contact me on Instagram but wasn't able to.

ItalyTravel,"Just got back from a great trip celebrating my wife’s 40th birthday, I relied on this sub quite a bit during the planning stage and thought I would share my experiences in the hope that it can help others.  We both love sitting outside a nice bar with a drink and watching the world pass by, so if you are looking for museum recommendations its probably best to skip this post, if you would like info on places to eat, drink and tips on transport then read on…
 
I decided to use Italy’s train network to travel from North to South and I’m glad I did, the trains in Italy are reliable, efficient and easy to use.  I downloaded the Trenitalia app and booked both the fast and regional trains well in advance, we used Frecciarossa trains on the fast lines, I paid a little extra to travel Business, this gives you a nice comfy leather reclining seat and complimentary snack box and drink during the journey.  If you can afford to do this I would recommend as it made the travelling between locations very relaxing.  Booking tickets on the app is simple and makes scanning and checking in (regional train tickets need to be checked in before departure) really easy, the app also allows you to check live updates and view platform information which is really handy.  I also planned to travel light, my wife and I had one cabin sized suitcase each which made life a lot easier when walking from the train stations to our chosen accommodation.
 
Day 1
We flew from the UK to Milano (Malpensa Airport), I planned to take the Malpensa Express train from the airport to Milano Centrale station, there is a train every 30 minutes and it takes 60 minutes to travel into central Milano.  I used my Trenitalia app to book the tickets when we landed (I didn’t book before in case the flight got delayed), the trains are well signposted and a short walk from the arrival gates at Terminal 2 where we landed.  Milano Centrale station is an impressive building, I booked the NYX hotel which is a 3-minute walk from the station.  I couldn’t fault the hotel which is very cool, or the staff who were helpful and friendly, it sits in a really good location for transport links around the city too.  After dropping our cases, we headed back over toward the station and used the Metro (subway/underground) to head down to the Duomo area, we bought a day ticket (valid for 24h) from the machines at the Metro station which allowed us to complete multiple journey’s while we were there.
It only takes around 7 minutes from Centrale to Duomo, again an impressive and great area to visit, we walked around, had a few Aperol Spritz at various bars and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II building (designer shopping area with restaurants and bars) is stunning and worth the hassle of negotiating the instagramers posing for photos.  We had gelato, drank and sat in the sun and enjoyed every minute, we then hopped back on the Metro and headed down to P.TA Genova station which is situated in the Navigli district of the city.  We spent the rest of the afternoon and evening along the Navigli canal, this area is rammed with bars and restaurants and is a great place to eat, drink and enjoy the sunset, crowds and fashion.  We headed back to the hotel using the Metro which only takes about 15 minutes.
 
Day 2
The NYX hotel does a good breakfast, we spent a couple of hours walking and enjoying different areas of the city before checking out of the hotel.  We used the Frecciarossa from Milano Centrale to Firenze, the trains are great, it only took 1h 30m to get to Firenze and was on time and comfortable.  I booked The Moon Boutique Hotel and Spa in Firenze, it is a little bit on the outskirts (20-minute walk to the centre) but the hotel was amazing, lots of white marble and ultra glam if that’s your thing (my wife loved it). 
We checked in, ditched the cases and then walked over to Mercato Centrale.  This place is great and has a great buzz, upstairs has a food court where you can get every type of Italian food you can think of, you find a table, scan the QR code and order your drinks and enjoy the food.  We then moved on and took a short walk to Piazza Di Santa Maria Novella where we sat outside and spent an hour people watching with a couple of Aperol’s, this area like most in Firenze is beautiful.  Our next appointment was at the Loggia Roof Bar located in the corner of Piazzo Santo Spirito (we don’t have a drink problem, honest!).  I booked a table in advance and the place did not disappoint, stunning views of the rooftops and great cocktails, the staff were kind, funny and friendly.  I had booked a table for dinner at Osteria Antica Casa Torre, we had a lovely stroll back over the river and Ponte Veccio toward the restaurant which is a small family run place in a great location.  My wife had the braised beef, I had the wild boar ragu, both amazing, the tiramisu was good along with the wine pairing that was recommended by our server.
 
Day 3 / Day 4
We spent the morning (after having another great breakfast at the hotel) exploring other areas, walked along the river, the Piazza della Repubblica and its surrounding streets.  The Piazza del Duomo and cathedral are absolute showstoppers and jaw droppingly beautiful, so good that I didn’t even mind paying 10 Euro for two rubbish cappuccino’s just so I could sit and admire it.
We checked out and headed back to the station, we boarded a regional train to Siena where we planned to spend two nights.  I was really looking forward to visiting Siena and I did but not as much I thought I would and I can’t really explain why.  It is really busy with tourists at this time of year, I know we were tourists and can’t complain about that but it seemed to cater more toward tourism and the service in some of the bars was a little abrupt and not that welcoming.  I did however have one of the best meals of our trip in Siena, La Taverna di San Giuseppe is a 5-10 minute walk from Piazza del Campo and wow, what a place.  Book in advance to avoid disappointment, we managed to get a lunch sitting, the food, wine and setting are perfect and was a highlight of the entire visit for both of us.  We also had dinner on one evening at Compagnia dei Vinattieri which did not disappoint either.  We stayed at Il Battistero Siena Residenza d’Epoca hotel which has its own unique charm and history, situated across from the Duomo and a few yards from Piazza del Campo, it sits in a perfect location in the heart of Siena.  The staff, especially Gisella could not have been more welcoming, and arranged wine tasting one afternoon at the hotels own Enoteca where we learnt about the history and different regions of Tuscany and its wines.
 
Day 5
This was our longest travelling day, we got the regional train back to Firenze (1h 30m) so that we could board a Frecciarossa on the fast line down to Roma (another 1h 30m travel time), the trains were on time, relaxing and we arrived at Roma Termini early afternoon.  I had booked the Triviho hotel which was a 15 minute walk from the station, another good hotel choice, this place is trendy and situated in a good location.  Roma was a little bit full on, but I had planned it that way because I knew we were there for a short time, we walked over to the Spanish Steps, then onto the Trevi fountain and finally the Colosseum.  All these places were amazing and we stopped off for refreshments along the way, the gentlemen who like to sell bracelets are more common around the Colosseum area but ignoring them or politely saying ‘no, grazie’ usually works a treat.  Roma has a great vibe and we wish we could have spent longer there to see more but we will just have to visit again in the future.
 
Day 6 / Day 7 / Day 8
Another lovely breakfast at the hotel, we spent the morning looking around the streets surrounding the hotel which was enjoyable.  We boarded another Frecciarossa from Roma to Napoli (1h 15m), this train was running a few minutes late but the trains throughout our visit were great and I can’t think of an easier way to travel around Italy.  Our final destination was Sorrento, I had read on the sub that the train from Napoli to Sorrento was not the best so I decided to book the ferry instead.  We arrived at Napoli Centrale, walked out and jumped into a taxi, the ride to Beverello Port takes 10 minutes and cost 20 Euro (close your eyes if you are a nervous passenger), I had booked ferry tickets in advance and used the Ferryhopper app which gives you journey information and the e-tickets.  The taxi driver dropped us off next to the ferry area, we headed for the Sorrento gate which is signposted, all you need to do is go to the relevant kiosk, show them the e-ticket or booking reference and they print off the valid paper ticket for you.  The ferry only takes 45 minutes, and you get great views of Napoli and Vesuvius as you sail along the coast toward Amalfi.
I booked the Hotel Continental, amazing hotel, facilities and staff but not cheap, from the ferry port you can walk and follow signs which take you to the lift.  The lift costs a couple of Euro’s but is a lot easier that climbing the many steps that lead up to Sorrento.  I paid a bit more for a sea view, its hard to put into words how amazing the views and scenery are, it feels like you are in a movie!  We both loved Sorrento, the busy streets, the countless bars, restaurants and clothes shops are something else, the souvenir shops selling limoncello and leather goods are also really nice without being in your face and trying to sell you things.  We had dinner at Café Latino which has a lovely outdoor area where you can eat amongst the many orange and lemon trees.  We had an amazing last evening dining experience at Il Buco restaurant, this place is fine dining and not the cheapest but it is located in a special setting and memorable.  I had the best Italian food of my life in Sorrento, Enjoy the little things bistro is exceptional and has been mentioned in this sub many times.  You can’t book, just queue up 20-30 minutes before it opens to guarantee a table, it is simple proper food done well, thank me later!  There are loads of bars but we particularly liked D’Anton, get a table outside which looks out over Piazza Sant’Antonino and work your way through the cocktail list.
Hotel Continental has an huge selection of breakfast items and was a lovely to start to each morning.  At the end of an amazing journey we headed back to Napoli Airport (pre-booked taxi 80 Euro) and flew back home feeling sad that we had to leave.
 
I’m expecting a backlash telling me that we did too much and missed lots, however, I ate some of the best food I’ve ever had, drank my own body weight in Aperol Spritz, got a nice suntan and had a great time.  We will be visiting again and now know for next time to spend multiple days in Firenze, Roma and Sorrento and explore the Amalfi coast a little more.

ItalyTravel,"I (44f) and my husband (39m) are a Canadian couple just back from a wonderful 2.5 week trip to Italy. Browsing this subreddit was helpful in our trip planning, so I thought I'd do a short writeup.

**Itinerary:** 

* 3 nights in Florence
* Then rented a car and spent a week driving around Tuscany (2 nights Siena with stops in San Gimignano and Montereggioni, 3 nights at a lovely agriturismo near Gaiole in Chianti, stop in Arezzo, 1 night at an agriturismo near Sansepolcro, 1 night in San Marino, stop in Ravenna)
* 3 nights Bologna with a half-day trip to Modena
* Train to Rome, 4 nights in Rome
* Flew to Malta for 5 nights to wrap the trip

We wanted a mix of cities and smaller towns. I'd previously been to tourist hotspots like Pisa and Venice, so I felt comfortable skipping them this time. I'd also been to Florence and Rome before, but my husband hadn't and wanted to see the major first-timer sights. We mixed those in with wine tasting in Chianti, medieval villages and history, seeing art, eating good food, and our personal favourite hobby of craft beer tasting.

**What we loved**

Most everything! Italy is truly magical. A few standouts and highlights:

* We both LOVED Bologna! A bit of a surprise, since we'd added it to the itinerary without any real expectations. The city doesn't have a ton of famous sights and attractions, but it has an amazing vibe. Great food, of course. But also just fun to walk around. 
* We took a cooking class at our agriturismo in Chianti. It was an incredible experience. A bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it.
* Wine tasting in Chianti was great. We switched off days driving so both of us could taste. A lot of people say you need to book in advance, but we had better luck just finding wineries with tasting signs on the side of the road, pulling in, and asking for a tasting. Most were paid tastings (they would've waived the fees if we'd bought bottles, but we couldn't take it home with us and we can only drink so much onsite) but one place offered us a free tasting and tour since they had a deal going with our agriturismo.
* The Porto del Cielo at the Cathedral in Siena was totally worth it. Do the Panorama climb too. It's such a great view and different perspective.

**What we'd do differently**

Not a whole lot, honestly. The trip went remarkably well. We're both fairly seasoned travellers so we didn't really have many issues with Italy, which is a fairly easy destination as far as world travel goes. Just a few things:

* Hindsight being 20/20, we may have skipped the Vatican (I'd already been, and my husband felt that though the art was amazing, the crowds weren't worth it). We also didn't love our agriturismo in Sansepolcro, but it was just an overnight stop. And it rained the whole time we were in San Marino, but, well, not much you can do about the weather.
* I might have put more effort into researching and pre-booking restaurants, especially on the weekends in busy cities like Florence and Rome. Usually when I travel, I just wander around, find somewhere that looks good, and eat. But in Italy, most of the good places book up early, and anywhere with open tables is liable to be a tourist trap. We ate well, and had a few lovely sit-down meals of note. But we also had good luck with sandwich stalls and markets, and even grocery stores.
* We stayed in the Centro area of Rome, which was great in being able to walk everywhere. But if I could do it over, I'd book someplace in Trastevere for the better restaurants and overall vibe. It's nearly as close to everything.
* We took the Leonardo Express to FCO Airport, but in hindsight it would've been just as fast and a few euros cheaper to take the regional FL1 train.
* Our car rental worked out fine-ish, but they (of course) did the thing where they claim they're sold out of the economy car we booked and wanted to give us a ""free upgrade"" to a much larger car. As you know, the roads in Italy are super narrow, winding, and there are tons of one-lane roads and small parking spots and tight spaces. Get the smallest car you can! We negotiated them down to a crossover SUV, but it felt huge going through the little side roads. 

**Logistical notes**

* **SIM cards:** I bought a TIM tourist SIM on arrival in Florence that gave me 100 GB for 30 days. I visited the shop across from the main train station, and at first they tried to sell me a package that cost double. When I showed them the printout of the TIM tourist offer, they said I had to register online for it and he could activate it in store. So I signed up on WiFi, got an activation code, and they set me up. It worked fine in Italy, and roamed fine in Malta (up to 16 GB is roaming in EU). My husband had an eSIM-enabled phone and got an Airalo, but had more problems with it, while my TIM physical SIM card worked perfectly.
* **Advance booking of tickets**: I pre-booked our visits to the Uffizi Gallery, the Florence Duomo, the Siena Cathedral Porto del Cielo, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the Vatican. Of those, only the Colosseum and the Vatican tickets were really challenging to get, but thanks to advice from this forum I was able to wake up at 3am and snag them. I highly recommend getting tickets first thing in the morning if possible to most of these things, as the crowds and heat were far more bearable. Note: Colosseum tickets go on sale exactly 30 days in advance, and Vatican tickets 60 days. 
* **Siesta schedule!** The midday sun is very hot, so avoiding it is the key to enjoying Italy, especially for sun-shy Canadians like us. It was cooler in Chianti and downright rainy and chilly in San Marino, but the rest of the trip, especially Rome, was intensely hot. The best times for sightseeing were mornings and after the sun went down. We got in the habit of taking siestas mid-afternoon.

**Safety**

No issues whatsoever. We're both big-city savvy and know how to look alert, avoid eye contact with touts, and be aware of our belongings. I'm not saying crime doesn't exist, but there's really no need to be paranoid in Italy. There were a few pushy bracelet scammers at the Roman Forum, but we just ignored them. 

**Packing tips**

* **Take a backpack, not a roller suitcase!** The number of times we saw people struggling with big rolling bags on cobblestones or up steep staircases was ridiculous. We both packed carry-on compatible backpacks and had plenty of space for everything we needed for a 3 week trip. There's really no need to overpack.
* **Book an apartment stay with laundry facilities** halfway through your trip. We did this for 3 nights in Bologna and were able to do all our washing at that point.
* **Pack for the heat**. Light, loose fabrics like linen and cotton are best. Take a good wide-brimmed hat, sunscreen, and bugspray -- the mosquitoes are rampant.
* **Pack for ""church-appropriate"" wear.** I packed mostly dresses and skirts that covered my knees and shoulders, a linen button-down, and a couple of t-shirts that covered my shoulders. My husband brought two pairs of lightweight slacks and a pair of long shorts that covered the knees, and lightweight short-sleeve button-downs. We saw so many people get turned away from entering beautiful churches because they weren't following the dress code. It just isn't worth it.
* **Tide2Go is the best thing we packed.** It's a basic law of physics: White clothing attracts orange sauce, red wine, gelato... you name it, we spilled it. Keeping a small detergent pen in my purse saved our outfits more than once.

I wish I knew the language a little better because when I went to Japan awhile back, I could conversate with local people and get to know the place a little better. (My Japanese is not really fluent but on a basic level). versus in Italy, I find myself subconciously just starting a convo in English because my Italian is non-existent. Even though many can somewhat understand English, I get an impression that some people feel pressured bc they have to conversate in a non-native language, and they guess my question and say ""yes"" even though that may not be the case or some phrases I can't understand 😂 (likely Italian phrases translated to English?)

ItalyTravel,"For those of you on FB, Rick Steve's page recently linked to a post from Cameron Hewitt who writes & travels for Rick in Europe. I won't share the link but it's right there on the Rick Steves FB page, you may have to scroll down a bit to find it. A lot of (mainly US) travelers swelter through early heat waves in IT and wonder why, like in the US, AC is not immediately available once the temp gets hot. As Cameron says in his post (he's in Venice FYI:

"" The vast majority of Venetian hotels have air-conditioning. They have to; you'd melt in July and August without it. The trick is...the AC isn't turned on yet.

During my visit, I've stayed in four different hotels. Each one, technically, is air-conditioned. And at each one, the AC unit — which jabs tauntingly out of the wall — won't turn on. In fact, some of them are blowing hot air, no matter how low I crank the dial.

That's because most Italian hotels have a system that's either/or, for the whole building. As the receptionist explained to me, ""Basically, if one person turns on the heat, and the other turns on the air-conditioning, the system will break."" As it's still pretty chilly at night (dipping into the 50s) — and it's still only April — they have the heat turned on, and the AC off.

Each time I switch hotels, I get the same apologetic explanation. At one place, the owner pleaded with me: ""Please explain this to your American guests. We have the heat on until April 15. Then we are legally required to turn it off. And we are not allowed to turn on the air-conditioning until May 15. Unless there is an emergency and the mayor gives us permission. We just had guests from your book, and they were very angry about this, but..."" And then he performed, just for me, the prototypical Italian Shrug.

Pro tip: I always immediately ask if I can borrow a fan (""ventilatore""). Most hotels have only a few...and they're first-come, first-served. Others don't even have fans at all. (On this trip, I was just one-for-four.) In that case, you simply sweat, while wishing that the radiator in the bathroom could be turned off.""

Everyone please be aware that AC is NOT an on-demand ""luxury"" as you may be used to back home and that you might be uncomfortable during your stay.

ItalyTravel,"Today I got harassed by a tram inspector in Milan. I had just gotten onto the tram, my partner and I tapped our bank cards, and we sat down. At the next stop, the inspector got on and automatically started accusing us of not paying and got out his eftpos machine to fine us. I told him “we just tapped our cards, we have paid”. He got out his machine and told us to tap to check, he said “no you only tapped just then because you saw I was getting on to check”. We argued about this for a minute or two with him insisting that I had only tapped because I saw the inspectors getting on?? Luckily, a local, who saw me tap was standing there and after asking her to support that we tapped on when we got on at the previous station she told him in Italian that we definitely tapped on.

ItalyTravel,"For context I've been living in Italy for a year and a half now, just South of Rome and I've loved every minute of it. I've travelled a bit to places like Sperlonga, Gaeta, Positano, Sorrento, Rome, Venice and recently Verona. 

I'm was so disappointed. Sure the old city is aesthetically beautiful but it just felt like a caricature of itself. All the stories I saw were global brands with some tourist focused speciality shops. The market in the main square was nothing but knick knacks and cheap souvenirs. The whole thing felt like the Disney version of an Italian city. I found it totally lacked soul and any kind of energy or Italian vibe. Maybe I'm just not as much of a fan of Northern Italy but I left feeling sad that so many cities in Italy are turning into these soulless theme parks for tourists. 

That being said I will always love Rome. While insanely crowded at times it still retains an energy of being a city of history and culture.

**Dates:** Sept 21st - Oct 6th 2024  

**Demo:** Two late 20s couple, Canada  

**Itinerary:** Rome (4 nights) -> Pompeii (0) -> Amalfi (3) -> Florence (4) -> Stresa (2) -> Milan (2)   

**General Notes:**  

* Download the Rick Steve Audio guide app. Give so much more context to what you are seeing inside museums and historical places.  

* Pack light if possible, we only had 1 carry-on each and a backpack.   

* Try to book most museums tickets in advance, saved us so much wait time.  

* 95% of places accepted credit cards but we did bring $1,000 euro to make things easier to pay most of the lunches, coffees, gelatos, tips for tour guides, etc. 

* We booked all trains between major cities in advance via the Omio app and had no issues.  

* On the other hand, tried using Freenow twice in Rome to call a taxi with no success, had to flag one down instead.

* Bring 2 good pairs of shoes if you plan to walk a lot, we averaged 15,000 steps a day (peak at 23,000).

&nbsp;

**Rome**:  

* Hotel: Navona Colors Hotel - Small boutique hotel very well located, breakfast included. Would recommend.

* Day 12: Isola Bella and Palazzo Borromeo in the morning. In the afternoon, we met up with a distant relative who brought us to Intra and Unchio on the other side of the lac. This is where my grandmother was born and lived until she was 7 before immigrating to Canada. We were able to FaceTime her and even found the house she grew up in! Definitely a highlight of the trip for me.
* Day 13: Visited two other small towns on the lake with my family member, Lesa and Arona. Took an afternoon train to Milan 

 &nbsp;

Overall it was it was an amazing trip and I’m happy that we did a lot of planning before hand on restaurants, activities, etc! We could definitely have done an extra day in most cities and definitely want to go back to most locations one day!",t2_2xz8ads8,"15 Days Trip Report: Rome, Amalfi, Florence, Milan, Stresa",0.89,28,1728652468.0,1728652468.0,37,BaCo-,1g19ic9
ItalyTravel,"Hi! Posted in this subreddit a couple of months ago looking for advice on my itinerary. After extensive research on multiple platforms, including multiple subreddits, our trip turned out to be absolutely wonderful. Still jet-lagged, but I wanted to give a quick rundown on our final itinerary. Really happy with how it all fell into place. Will do a more in-depth post later, including the places we ate at and takeaways for each place.  It's quite a busy itinerary, but we saw a LOT and also relaxed a bit so this worked well for us. We started off in the north and then went to the south.

1) Started off in Switzerland (misleading, I know) - flew into Zurich. Stayed with a friend (2 days). Took the ferry on the lake, walked the main streets, saw Rheinfalls, and the Lindt Chocolate Factory (!!!HIGHLY recommend!!! - we ate more chocolate than should be humanly possible). Ate raclette with potatoes one night at their house and fondue another night. Can't stop thinking about it.

2) From Zurich, we took a regional train to Chur in Switzerland (1.5 hrs). Here we boarded the Bernina Express - the scenic panaromic train through the Swiss/ Italian Alps to Tirano in Italy (around 4 hrs). A rare experience, so we opted for the second-class tickets which are by the panaromic glass-roofed windows. 
At Tirano, we took a regional train to Milan (2.5hrs). The views were absolutely stunning, there is a photostop, I can't recommend the Bernina enough.

3) Nearly 2 days in Milan. Visited the Navigli (canals) district (lively scene, fun walk, great food!), did a tour of The La Scala Opera House Museum (rehearsal was in session which was fun to see), Sforza Castle (I thought it was a skip tbh), a rooftop tour of the Duomo Cathedral (an experience worth more than the regular tour, I think - we took great pictures + learned about the construction), explored the area around the Duomo including Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele and Corso Vittorio Emmanuele. Went to see the Last Supper but tix were sold out. Saw Parco Sempione. Got pickpocketed at Milan Central Station. Overall, I think a day is enough in Milan. I didn't really love the city, wouldn't return. 

3) Train to Lake Como- Stayed in Como city (2 days). Had gelato by the lake, took the funicular up to Brunate for sunset - walked up to the lighthouse too (stunning, gorgeous views!!!), took a guided tour of Varenna & Bellagio. All the towns are absolutely beautiful but Varenna especially so. Bellagio was lovely, but a bit crowded. In Como, took the walk up to Cernobbio by the lake (lovely beaches+ villas+ gardens). 

4) Left Lombardia to Liguria. Car to Santa Margherita Ligure in Genoa (2 days). Might have been one of my favourites of all time. This town was out of a painting or dream. Lovely beaches, we took the bus to Portofino and back for an evening (dream!! cliffside swimming + sunset walk by a hidden beach too), next day was spent in Genoa (1hr train ride) - took the funicular at Zecca-Righi, and used the lifts all over the city to see the viewpoints, walked around, visited the marina, had pesto & foccacia. The next morning took a bus to Rapallo where we took an absolutely gorgeous cable-car ride up to Montallegro and back. 

4) Car from Santa Margherita Ligure to Riomaggiore in Cinque Terre. Opted out of making La Spezia as our base as we found affordable accommodation in one of the main 5 villages. Walked The Path of Love (Via Dell'Amore) to Manarola where we caught an unforgettable sunset. Explored the town and walked back the Walk of Love a little before midnight. Next day took the day pass for the ferry (!!!!! idk why more people don’t recommend this here : a much better option than the day pass on the train!! less congested + the right way to see the villages is from the ocean) and explored Monterosso (lazed out on the beach), Vernazza for a few hours, even squeezed in an hour at Corniglia (!!so many stairs + no ferry here as it’s elevated on a cliff so had to take a separate train ticket from Vernazza and back- but the basil gelato + the views are worth it!). Sunset at Riomaggiore. 

5) Lombardia to Campania. 7-hour road trip to Napoli (3days). Hands-down my favourite place in the trip, I never wanted to leave this city. Lively, gritty, friendly, vivid, vibrant. Tour of the Royal Palace. Walked through the Spanish Quarters (lovedd!!! Via Toledo), saw Murale di Maradona 1989, day trip to Capri (too crowded!! too expensive!! lovely boat ride + stunning chairlift at Anacapri - otherwise would rather opt to visit Ischia/Procida. The Blue Grotto was closed - they decide each morning if it will be open based on the sea condition as the opening to the cave is very small, heard it's a 3 hour wait on a small boat in the heat for 5 mins inside so maybe for the best), day trip - guided tour of Mount Vesuvius and Pompei. Rainy morning, could have been clearer at Vesuvio - couldn't really see the crater. Pompei is beautiful, but I did hear the ruins at Herculaneum are better preserved and probably worth visiting as an alternative. In the evenings we explored the food of Napoli as much as we could. Walked a lot of the city in the process. I can spend eternities here, I love the people. Have to mention dinner at Trattoria di Nennella - the true Neapolitan experience!! what a wonderful night!!! Dancing, singing waiters and the entire restaurant of Italians + an affordable 3-course meal. Walked some more neighbourhoods in the mornings. 

6) Napoli to Minori on the Amalfi Coast (2days). Walked the Path of Lemons to neighbouring Maiori, sunset on the beach. Took the ferry back. Explored Minori. Took the ferry to Amalfi and Positano. Positano was entirely too hot the day we went - thought I was having a heatstroke + all the steps + crowds. It's absolutely stunning though. Took a sunset boat ride with snorkelling.  The cathedral at Amalfi is gorgeous. Walked to Atrani from Amalfi and back.

7) Stunning scenic drive on Amalfi Drive to Sorrento. We stayed in the outskirts midway between Sorrento city and Positano. (2days) Revisited Positano, which redeemed itself as the weather was pleasant - stunning viewpoints, lovely time on the beach, an absolute blast of a time dancing at Music on The Rocks - a nightclub in a cave. (entry was free cause we ordered drinks at their restaurant outside) 
Next day we explored Sorrento. Picturesque and laidback. A great choice to end the trip. Visited Villa de Communale (free park with stunning cliffside ocean views+ live music!!!), walked the main streets, explored and had free samples at the shops!!!, I took a 2-hour Neapolitan pizza class for lunch which was awesome. Got entry to one of the beachclubs for a reduced price (10 euros instead of 20) as we were there 2.5 hours before they closed - the weather was perfect! lesser crowds! caught a sunset, the water was great - clear blue. They had a solarium - we tanned and swam in the ocean. Wine + gelato + a supermarket meal to end the trip. Flew out of Naples. 

Feel free to ask me questions. I'll explain what we could have done differently and general travel advice in another post. ",t2_5vdyozf6,Just back from a 17-day Italy trip! ,0.85,27,1727872169.0,1727872169.0,14,andthatsthatbro,1fuezxh

ItalyTravel,"First time traveling to Europe, I'll keep this short, perhaps some others planning a trip may find something worthwhile.

3 Days in Florence:  Stayed in a rental apartment which was cheap, had bad AC, no good views, but was cozy and clean and *everything* was within a 15 minute walk.  *Highlights*:  Uffizi was amazing, I heard you could blow through it in 3 hours so I booked another site that day, and only saw half of what was there.  Easily could have spent all day there.  Palazzo Vecchio was also mindblowing, I can't recommend it enough.  The Duomo surpasses all hype, it really is that great, the stairs weren't as bad as some make it sound.  Also did Palazzo Pitti, also worth it.  Mercato Centrale was an easy place to get food.  We enjoyed just wandering around the city.

4 days wandering Tuscany:  Stayed outside Siena, great location, great lodging (La Coroncina).  Saw Siena, Montepulciano, San Gimignano, Volterra (somewhat), Pienza, took a cooking lesson with Jacopo Tendi, a local cooking instructor.  I could not recommend Jacopo's class enough, he is super chill, patient, knowledgeable, and managed the four of us while we all cooked a giant meal, learned a lot about the science of cooking.  San Gimignano was touristy, sure, but I'd go back in a heartbeat, I found it enchanting.  Montepulciano was beautiful, but is a one-and-done for me, since similar views of Val d'Orcia can be found in Pienza which really appealed to me more than I thought it would.  We didn't get to see much of Volterra, it seems *slightly* more modernized than the other towns, but the Etruscan museum was one of the highlights of the whole trip.  Siena was the standout though, that place seems older and more medieval when you first enter, but it grew on us to become our favorite place in Tuscany.  Needed a *lot* more time there.  

Amalfi:  Stayed in Conca dei Marini.  I rented a car which was unnecessary in hindsight, the bus system was far easier to use and understand than I was willing to accept.  Conca is a stone's throw from Amalfi, which was a fine place but we mostly used it for the marina.  The ferry rides are amazing, the ferry rides are the bread-and-butter of an Amalfi experience.  People say Positano is overrated or over-hyped, but my family and I really enjoyed it, just avoid the pay beaches.  Capri....  well, its not for me.  The marina is a tourist trap, no other ways about it.  The central area is all about designer brand shopping.  The ferry ride there was *long*, making us unwilling to submit to busing around the island, perhaps if we had we would have enjoyed it more.  It just felt like the most tourist trap area of Italy we visited.

Other takeaways:  In Tuscany, wake up early and get started, the best attractions close early.  Save the chill wandering for late afternoon.  In Amalfi, don't rush.  There is no benefit that I can tell, just relax and enjoy.  Driving in Italy is said to be difficult, I didn't find that true at all, people drive the same as they do back home (NYC metro).  Roads are narrow and curvy (in Amalfi) but I never felt nervous or unsafe, its not that bad.

ItalyTravel,"Couple months ago was able to snag two tickets for $200 direct flights for my girlfriend and I. It was our first time in Rome, but my gf speaks fluent Italian so that came in handy at various times.

* Staying in Trastevere. We got to our AirBnB by 7:30 in the morning and immediately hit the streets. We lucked out on our spot; found a ground-level apartment with nice cafes and fantastic restaurants nearby - shoutout to Da Nina for their carbonara and tiramisu. And Roma Sparita for an amazing cacio e pepe in a bowl of crusted parmesan. On the island in between the center of Rome and Trastevere is a little gelato stand connected to a restaurant - it's only open from 11-5 but it's fantastic. One little prosicuterria in Trasteveria is also of note: Cantina dei Papi. Our order of choice was a simple porchetta sandwich - literally just porchetta and a circular roll of foccacia - and it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. 
* We walked a ton, like 25-30k steps a day, just taking everything in. Stumbling into ruins was a truly life-altering experience. Public transport is very easy; just swipe your credit/debit card to a machine and that's it (for a longer stay we probably would have got a metro pass). You don't have to be crazies like us and walk everywhere but we found it countered the arancinis, gelato, pasta, and pizza.  
* From a recommendation on Reddit I led us to the galleries at Barberini and Corsini. Barberini was outstanding. Corsini was smaller and their less-than-intuitive application to find descriptions of the paintings was outright bad; but still cool to visit. The two-for-one deal was worth it. Coliseum, the Forum, and Palatine Hill were the real highlights though. Circus Maximus too. I got into the Capitoline Museums for 2 euros since I had a ticket for the Italy v Scotland match (my gf got into everything for free 'cause she has a press card). Next time we'll do the 4 combined museums (Baths of Diocletian, Crypta Balbi, etc). Riding the tandem bike-cart in Villa Borghese was ridiculously fun as well. Piazza Nuovo, Lateran Obelisk, Trevi Fountain (only really saw on first day with little to no crowd), Largo di Argentina was also very cool, etc. 
* My first international rugby match at the Stadio Olimpico was a blast. Fans of both nations were excellent; and it was special to see Italy grind out a win after being down early. Getting back to Trastevere was a clusterfuck because the buses were too packed but, after walking a couple kilometers I found a bus which took me back. All in all, a special moment (even if I had to watch the game alone).
* Funny thing was, seemed like most of the tourists were Italians themselves. And of courses the Scots roaming around in their kilts!

We hope to come back again in the future because 4 days is simply not enough but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Beautiful city of which we saw just a drop. ",t2_10vzga,4 Days in Rome.,0.94,27,1710160538.0,1710160538.0,3,Brotendo88,1bc24rc
ItalyTravel,"Venice sounds like an incredible place. Why don’t people spend more time there?

There is a tremendous amount of history, culture, art, food, and more. The city itself is a miracle.

But I can barely find anyone who has done more than a few nights.

I know the obvious answer: “it’s too crowded”. But I also know it gets much less crowded after the day-trippers leave, and it’s easy enough to dodge the crowds by exploring the blocks outside of the main tourist areas.

My best guess is that it is a very expensive place to stay overnight, and the idea of going to Venice alone is odd when there is so much else to do in northern Italy.

Is that right? Or are there other reasons people don’t spend more time in Venice?",t2_pyhe0,Why don’t people spend more time in Venice?,0.84,28,1704596485.0,1704596485.0,96,handipad,190hxix
ItalyTravel,"As the title states, my family and I just got back from another wonderful trip to Italy. We spent 17 days and went from North to South! 

Itinerary 

Sept 11-12: Overnight flight from YYZ to VCE

Sept 12-15: Landed early morning in Venice and near Rialto. We did Murano, Burano, and Cimitero all in one day. We walked the entirety of Venice but spent a lot of time in Castello. 

Sept 15 - 19: We took a freccia to Milano and then a regional train to Tortona! We have family here and we spent our days with them. We did a day trip to Genoa and a day trip to Torino. 

Sept 19 - 23: We took an afternoon regional train from Tortona to Piacenza and then Piacenza to Bologna to see (you guessed it!) more family. I loved Bologna even though we were all sick the 3 days we were there.

Sept 23 - 29: We took an early freccia from Bologna Centrale and went 7 hours south to Rosarno. From Rosarno we went to my families hometown, Siderno. We did a day trip to Gerace and one to Reggio. We spent time with family and it was just the best. 

Sept 29: We had an early morning transfer to Lamezia and flew Lamezia to Rome and Rome to Toronto. It was about a 20 hour travel day. 


Highlights

So for the trip I made sure to keep track of places we had been on google maps which I will link here: 
https://maps.app.goo.gl/yz6JoBxUMtRetDCp7?g_st=i

Things to note:

- We had been to Venice previously and already had a sense of what we wanted to do. We didn’t spend much time at places like San Marco because we had done that before. We just loved Burano and had to go again and we used the Homo Faber guide on Murano to find genuine artisans. 

- We had planned to do a day trip from Bologna before getting sick and it can easily be done! But definitely don’t miss out on what Bologna has to offer, it was such a wonderful city.

- The train down south was long but it was the most relaxing. Flying definitely could’ve been quicker but we had business class seats on the freccia and it went by in a flash!

- If you’re a History buff do NOT miss out on the history of Reggio, Locri, and the other coastal cities. It was truly incredible to dig deeper into it and gave us a better picture of our families place and history there. The museum in Reggio is amazing. 

Takeaways 

As much as I love the North and visiting it, the South is where my hearts at. It truly feels like home to me. ",t2_2i4hhpu4,Successful 3rd trip to Italy!,0.91,27,1728051290.0,1728051290.0,16,tmatokng,1fw06m0

ItalyTravel,"We did Rome, Cinque Terre, Florence, then rented a place in the Chianti region and visited the surrounding countryside including San Gimignano, Greve, and Siena. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!

We are both well travelled but this was his first time in Italy, while I had been a handful of times growing up. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and can’t wait to return in the future!

1. Italians were AMAZING with our toddler. I have never seen him so fussed over and made to feel so special- my husband and I continually felt so warm and fuzzy over the love he was shown by everyone, from strangers in the street to serving staff to shop owners. Even at the airport, every single waiting line had a separate family line and we were treated wonderfully.

2. Felt totally safe throughout with normal precautions and awareness. I had my regular small crossbody handbag kept on my front, with my hand on it in crowded spaces, and husband had a money belt as an alternative to keeping phone & wallet in pockets. No problems or any sense of feeling less safe than any other global, big cities.

3. Rome was beautiful but surprisingly neither of us loved it how we expected to. Maybe the crowds and such heavy tourism (I realize we added to this…)? So happy to have seen the sights and the food was amazing, but wouldn’t rush back. 

4. Trying to use a stroller in Rome was so tough with the really uneven sidewalks/cobbles, vehicles parked over sidewalks, often no flattening of the curb at crossings etc. Florence was much easier.

5. VERY happy we chose to stay in Monterosso vs our original choice of Vernazza in Cinque Terre. With our toddler the beach access was great in Monterosso plus it felt much less crowded than Vernazza. We had an apartment overlooking a little square in the old town and absolutely loved it.

6. Cinque Terre was overall much less crowded than I expected, which was wonderful. It was only when we were leaving Friday afternoon that it was a lot busier.

7. We rented a car and driving in Italy (Florence, Tuscan countryside, San Gimignano, Siena, then back to Rome airport) went better than expected. The cities were a little wild and sometimes navigation was hard, but outside the cities no problems at all and felt safer than on American highways.  

8. The food and wine were as amazing as expected. Just so fresh and we loved it. Don’t eat right next to tourist spots. We knew this but still did it once after a tiring day and regretted it (so overpriced and below average food). 

9. Was very happy I’d done my research, read up on tips and suggestions, and learned a few phrases. It made the trip more enjoyable and we felt like it improved our experiences.

10. Trains were great- our were pretty much on time and comfortable. Key is to pack light. I would not have liked to have used them with large cases as we saw some doing.

11. We were very happy with our combo of city to countryside/town- it created good balance and pace.

ItalyTravel,"Arrived at Rome Fiumicino with my bf today and while we were trying to sort out transportation to our airbnb (we were outside the airport) we were approached by two guardia finanza officers who asked to see our passports. They asked us questions about where we were from and what our plans were in Italy; they told us they thought it was strange we were only in Rome for the night, travelling to Croatia and Bosnia the next day and questioned us quite a bit about that. Mind you we’re from Canada and flights to Europe are limited/ expensive, hence the overnight stay in Rome. They entered our ppt info into some database on their iPad but the 2nd officer also proceeded to take pictures of our passports on his cellphone before handing them back to us…? This seemed strange but they were in full uniform and we were tired from a long flight and not in position to argue. Anyone have any insight?

ItalyTravel,"Ciao a tutti,

Im staying in a bed&breakfast in a small city in Italy. I made somewhat liberal use of the a.c. due to the heat and it ended up causing water damage in the wall beneath the machine and the upper part of the wood frame of the door. To make it worse, I left without noticing the water droplets dripping down the door like an utter idiot.

I feel absolutely terrible about it and need to know if this could cause a big problem. Are hotel owners obligated to have insurance for such occurences? Will it be repaired no/low cost to the owner? Do i need to get ready to pitch in to the payment?

ItalyTravel,"I had a lovely time.  I found eating out a little expensive but since I don't drink alcohol, it wasn't bad enough to worry me. The mass of red flags and shady practices I was warned against - never happened.  I'm an older lady and people were helpful and patient with my shaky Italian.  Some waiters were a bit grumpy (tho oddly not the waitresses) but since I hated food service when I was younger, I don't blame them.

The Duomo - seriously - THE DUOMO!!! I visited twice because, honestly, it's that good. If I'd been staying longer, I'd have gone again.

That said I should never have gone in July, it was far far too hot for this porky Briton, which cut down what I could do but it was worth every sweaty hour toiling up the hills. Mind you, if I'd gone later in the year I'd have missed the marble images in the floor of the DUOMO which are covered a lot of the time.  They are spectacular!

If you go in July, drink more water than I did on day one.  Had to spend the morning of day two recovering.

I used trains to get from Pisa Airport and every single one was late, so leave plenty of time if you use trains too.  Consider a hand fan, only one of the four trains I took had Aircon.

So, having visited Venice, Verona, Padua, Naples and now Siena - is there somewhere else I should go before I tackle Rome?  Another magnificent Cathedral to be wowed by?",t2_82pw3,Leaving Siena,0.91,26,1721825080.0,1721825080.0,15,Lumpyproletarian,1eb0jyq

But then I wondered if there are anything specific that the locals might love that isn't known/presented to the tourists?

ItalyTravel,"TL:DR:  The time on the ticket is the entry time to the underground experience, not the entry time to the colosseum!

Sharing my experience so folks who booked the *full experience ticket (including underground and arena access)* from the official website could know more about the process which was not mentioned in the confirmation email nor the ticket, nor on the official website (if it's there it's not prominently displayed). This is the version which is not the guided tour. 

**Process & tip:**
The visit starts strictly with underground access first which is an accompanied tour that starts on the timeslot on the ticket! So you got to go through the queuing,  finding out where to go next, clear security checks, clear your confusion if any, where is your meeting point etc way before that. 


**Queue to get inside the colosseum:**
There were 3 lines which were not well managed as people eventually crowd around it, making the lines indistinguishable. The lines were also not moving at some point. My ticket was eventually scanned in a few minutes before my ticketed time.


**My experience**
Anyhow, I learned later on there's a group meeting point even for self-guided underground access and I was told my group has left. The place was a mess and confusing for me to validate if that's really the case anyway. There were multiple meeting points meant for different groups. I was not able to visit the underground as a result. This was after speaking to the resolution desk.

There was also a group of other individuals who were under the guided tour option left stranded as they were told to wait and before they knew it their timeslot has passed and was not able to visit the underground too.

ItalyTravel,"We just got back from a wonderful trip in the northern part of Italy with our 3-year-old. Having spent 2 weeks on one of our best trips so far, I really want to thank a bunch of fellow redditors who helped refine our itinerary and suggested places which otherwise would not have made it to our plan!

**Day 1 | Milan:** We took a flight from India and landed in Milan in the afternoon. Milan was just the arrival point for us and we did not intend to visit Milan as such, so we ended up booking a room in the hotel at the Malpensa Airport itself. Nothing much that day; a bit of rest and a delicious dinner were a great start to our trip.

**Day 2 | Drive from Milan to Bellagio:** Woke up after a good night's sleep (a much needed one after the long sleepless flight the day before). Breakfast at the hotel was really good with a lot of options for everyone. We had booked a car through SIXT at the Malpensa airport. Getting the car was a breeze with great service from the representative at the SIXT counter. The drive to Bellagio was a very good one. I was still getting used to the car, since I come from a land of right-hand drive and switching to a left-hand drive meant putting in a lot more focus on the road. Driving along the Lake Como was a fantastic experience. We reached Bellagio by lunch time and our AirBnB was ready for us. The rest of the day was at leisure, with a casual walk around Bellagio, through the city center and along the lake.

**Day 3 | Bellagio to Varenna:** Took a ferry to Varenna and had breakfast at a lake side cafe. With great weather on our side, a cup of coffee and a little pastry seemed more blissful than we thought of! We had signed up for a picnic on the hills of Camaggiore, a 40-minute drive from the Varenna ferry station. We had our representative waiting for us and she drove us to the picnic spot, sharing tales from the towns of Lake Como, showing us amazing views along the way. The picnic itself was surreal, with the most beautiful view of the lake from 1200 meters above. We spend the rest of the day exploring Varenna at our pace, while our little one slept like a log in the stoller.

**Day 4 | Bellagio:** After debating weather to visit the Como town or not, we decided to stay in Bellagio in explore the town a bit more. We took a ride of the Bellagio Express, the toy train that takes you around the town. It was a fun ride, intended for our toddler, who decided to doze off in the train itself! Post that, we saw the gardens of the Villa Melzi. We had rented a boat to explore the lake ourselves during the evening, but rainy weather made us cancel our plans. We spent the rest of the evening, relaxing at our AirBnB, overlooking the lake.

**Day 5 | Drive from Bellagio to Gardaland:** Moving on to the next leg of our trip, which was clearly planned keeping our little boy in mind, we drove to Gardaland reaching there by noon. Thanks to a wonderful fellow Redditor, we got introduced to this wonderland called Gardaland!   
Our stay was booked at the Gardaland Hotel and while we were waiting for our room to get ready, we decided to pay a visit to the Gardaland Resort park right away. A drizzly weather kept most of the visitors inside the SEA Aquarium, but that also meant we had absolutely no waiting times on most of the rides in the park! The little one was elated to see the Peppa Pig Land, and refused to move away from it. All in all, day one in the park was a super success despite the wet weather. Evening at the hotel was full of fun-filled activities for the kids. The entertainment team at Gardaland Hotel did a fabulous job at keeping kids engaged.

**Day 6 | Gardaland:** Our second day in the Gardaland park was a much more planned one, since we had already explored some of the park on the previous day. We knew the rides we wanted to go on, and so logistics were simpler. Weather was great too, and so we had a wonderful time! The park has a plethora of options to eat, with a ton of sweet treats along the way. The park is huge but very well laid out with clean facilities. Naturally, day two also could not be completed without visiting our favorite Peppa Pig! Evening at the hotel was again fun-filled with the team at Gardaland doing what they do the best!

**Day 7 | Parco Natura Viva:** Gardaland is in proximity to a lot of amusement parks and points of recreation for family and friends. One of them is Parco Natura Viva, a zoo with a drive-through safari. It was a Saturday and the zoo had enormous waiting times for the cars to enter the Safari. After having waited in the queue for over an hour, we finally started the Safari, which turned out to be pretty great.   
Next, we had the fauna park (the walkable part of the zoo), the one with animals in their enclosures. With the entire park divided into geographical zones, it was fun seeing animals from various continents. The place is well-maintained, and creates a great experience for kids.

**Day 8 | Verona:** We had kept an extra day in Gardaland just in case the little man wanted to visit the park again. However, given the proximity, we decided to do a day trip to Verona instead. We drove to Verona and parked our car in one of the paid parking lots. We had reserved a morning slot for a walking tour, that took us through the streets of Verona, with our very knowledgeable guide sharing tales from historic Verona, the castle and gate to the old city center. The center was bustling with stores and eateries. Very touristy but was all the more fun! Our taste buds were craving for some Indian food and we ended up having lunch at an amazing Indian restaurant named ""Maharajah"". The food was delectable with very prompt service. As touristy as it sounds, we did go to ""Casa di Giulietta"", commonly known as Juliet's house that is known for the legacy of Romeo and Juliet having been inspired from there. The so-called Juliet's balcony is missable at best.

**Day 9 | Drive from Gardaland to Venice:** Switching to the last leg of our trip, this was supposed to be the wife's part of the trip. She has wanted to visit Venice for as long as she remembers, and this trip could not have happened without a leisurely stay in the city of canals! This was also the last day of us keeping the car, and we drove to Venice Marco Polo Airport where we returned the car at the SIXT counter. Once again, just like the pick-up the return process was extremely smooth and lasted barely a couple of minutes. Our plan was to catch the Alilaguna airport water bus to the main island, but we decided to splurge at the last moment and took the water taxi instead. And boy were we happy! The water taxi is an experience in itself, especially when entering the canals from the airport. Our AirBnB was located right on the Grand Canal, giving us uninterrupted views of the Canal. For a place that looked better in person than in pictures, what more could we have asked for!  
We spent the evening walking to the Rialto Bridge, people-watching!

**Day 10 | St. Marks square and Dodge's Palace:** After a good night's sleep, we woke up refreshed, taking in the morning views of the Grand Canal, with the gondola's and the various boats floating by, doing their chores for the day. We had booked a tour of the St. Marks square and the Basilica, along with the Dodge's Palace. Unfortunately, it had to be a rainy day. While we still participated in the tour, the place became very crowded because a lot of people tried to maximize on the time indoors to avoid the rain. Nonetheless, it was a good experience. The little one dozed off in the Basilica and so we let my wife carry on with the tour of the palace, while I took a table under an umbrella at the Cafe Lavena to get myself some coffee, and to let my son enjoy his sleep.   
We spent the evening loitering around the Rialto market, spoiling ourselves with a few gelatos at Suso!

**Day 11 | Murano, Burano and Torcello:** We woke up early, fixed ourselves some breakfast and were ready to leave. We had booked a tour of the 3 islands and our job was to get to the meeting point as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we missed our group and had to visit the islands on our own. The upside to this was that we could do it at our own pace! This included having a hearty lunch at a beautiful local cafe in Torcello. This place had a chidren's play area too! This also meant spending more time than necessary in Burano, because why not? We loved the colorful houses on the island and we just wanted to be there, taking in everything it had...

**Day 12 | Leisure and Photoshoot:** My wife and I generally have this idea of booking a small photoshoot at every exquisite location we visit. This not only gives us great pictures for memories, but it also allows us to see areas which we would otherwise not know existed. We booked this experience through AirBnB and our photographer was a wonderful man, very learned and a true Venetian at heart! He took us to places that were free of tourists, for some amazing pictures. Not only that, he also arranged for a special Gondola ride for us, which took us through the narrower canals of Venice, adding to the already special experience. A trip to Venice is really incomplete without a Gondola ride, and we were glad we could!  
This was the last evening of our trip and we could not conclude it without a few more Aperol Spritz's and Gelatos from Suso! 

With every trip we take, we learn a lot, that helps us make our future trips better. We consciously chose to skip the more popular locations like Rome and Florence (Tuscany), since we wanted to have ample time of leisure and just do nothing, with a toddler who wanted to just be.

If I could summarize the learnings of this trip, they would be:

* Travelling with a toddler is great, if you leave a lot of room for rest and leisure. It not only allows you to be, but it also leaves scope to rome around the place and absorb the local life beyond the tourist favourites
* Lake Como has a lot to offer. While day trips from Milan sound good, staying in a Lake Como town lets you enjoy the serenity of the lake in a more intimate manner. A couple of days at the least, three days to make it worth while.
* Driving around Lake Como can be fun, but can also become a bit intimidating if you are trying to drive slow on the roads that circle the lake and there are cars behind you, trying to get ahead. Staying calm is the key!
* Gardaland is unchartered territory for people outside Italy, and if travelling with kids, must find a place in the itinerary.
* We had a lot of people advising us against spending 4 days in Venice, but we do not regret it even a bit. Venice is a city unlike anything we've been to so far. It is very difficult to imagine the daily life of the people living there, unless you decide to stop and slow things down yourself, experiencing the little things that the place has to offer. 
* It is absolutely ok to not cover every point of interest at a place you are staying. Ticking everything off the list does not give the same satisfaction as enjoying the few things that you do, at a pace that you like.
* Lastly, strollers are a boon, even with the cobbled streets. They serve a great deal for quick afternoon naps, as well as meal times. It indeed is a pain carrying them over the hundreds of bridges in a place like Venice, but the pros still outweigh the cons.",t2_9bugfc7v,"Post trip report | Two weeks with a toddler (Lake Como, Gardaland, Venice)",0.96,26,1715683311.0,1715683311.0,16,More_Helicopter_688,1crp1lg
ItalyTravel,"Wife and I will be celebrating our 25th anniversary in September and decided to go to Italy for our first time.
We love southern Italian food,(and my heritage is there) but realized it’s difficult to see all of Italy in less than 3 weeks and we’ve taken 15 days off so decided to visit northern Italy and the lakes for the romance.
We fly into Milano and spend 2 nights there. We then rent a car to travel up to northern tip of Lake Lugano (20 mins to Lake Como) to spend 3 nights wandering the lakes/mountains and enjoy our anniversary dinner on the lake and be all romantic like.
We change to Lago d’Orta near Orta San Guilio to mix it up a bit for another 2 nights.
Drive back to Milan, give up car, then train to Cinque Terra/ Riomaggiore for 2 nights. 
Then Florence for 2 nights and end our trip in Rome with 3 nights and fly out from there.
We’ve got hotels in each of our locations but all are refundable.
We have 5 nights in the lakes because we want to chill; have been raising kids and working our asses of for years, now they’re graduating college and this is for us and all we want is to chill, eat, drink wine and go anywhere our hearts desire in the beautiful lakes region on our own time without having to worry about busses, trains and schedules while there. We’ve chosen out of the way places to get away from the throngs, at least in the lakes.
We also want the culture of the cities and I hope we will have enough time in Florence and Rome (and Milan) to hit the highlights, at least.
We’ve read about all the tickets to buy in advance, mostly from this sub, thank you, and we feel we’ve planned a pretty good itinerary, but since we’ve never been, we thought we’d ask the experienced people here for their thoughts.

I’ll be in Florence with my fiancé in early July after staying in southern Tuscany. We’re leaning toward spending 5-6 days based in Florence while exploring neighboring areas rather than packing up and going town-to-town but I’m trying to avoid a situation where we’re moving around too much, backtracking, not visiting sights at the right time, going to lame places, etc.

ItalyTravel,"My boyfriend and I are leaving Italy today after spending an entire month backpacking, traveling mostly by foot and a few trains. I have read so many useful tips on this sub, but one thing I haven’t seen much talk about is needing cash for city tourist tax. 

We stayed in 20+ different accommodations, spending 3 nights in Venice, 1 night in Pisa, then walking 400 kilometers from Lucca to Rome on the Via Francigena, staying in a different city or village for 20 nights in a row. After 4 nights in Rome, we took a train to Puglia and 4 more days on foot between Bari and Bríndisi. 

Every accommodation required us to pay a city tax, most of the time in cash. I made all of the arrangements on booking.com and only in a few circumstances, was the city tax included in the payment made directly to booking.com. Even if I paid for the booking in advance, I still had to pay the city tax in cash when checking into the properties. 

The tax ranged between €1-€5 per person, per night, with the most common amount being €2 per person, per night. 

When the booking was at a hotel, the receptionist was usually able to make change, but when the booking was an apartment with a private host, sometimes they were struggling to make change. In many circumstances, the check in was done remotely, and we were to leave exact change in the apartment. 

We were carrying plenty of cash, but making sure we had change and small bills became a daily effort. The best place for breaking big bills for us was the supermarket. We would stop to buy a few groceries daily and pay in cash to keep a constant supply of small bills and change to pay the city taxes. 

I suppose that for those who travel to just a few cities and stay in just a few hotels, this may not be an issue. But if you find yourself wandering the countryside and small villages and staying in bookings by private hosts, you’re going to need some cash handy.

I was just travelling Italy (home now) and leaving from Naples Airport, I went to baggage drop off counter c17-19 one of those 3 counters can't remember exactly (on the left) and I was told my bags were not paid for yet, Flying with Air Lufthansa, then connecting to Air Canada, (but this was Lufthansa desk) so at first I hand her my amex and she messes around with it swiping inserting doesn't even try tapping, telling me it doesn't work, so then I had her another card, and I did not use at all for anything else the whole trip in fact I never use this card for anything, so I know for sure it was here. 

  
I have already reported to my bank, thankfully I got an email and text pretty quickly and I called verified everything and cancelled card. 

  
Im wondering if I should report this to the airline aswell, (the fraud dept said if this is happening tho the merchants will be notified  and investigated at bank level etc etc and there should be more reports, but I realized the frauded charges didn't happen there so idk how they will find out)

also wondering now if these baggage charges were even legit or if she took advantage of my situation, I thought I did pay for these, but Im not sure I do think I only paid for the first round for flying to Italy not both yet so I accepted paying.

ItalyTravel,"Hi folks,

I found a lot of useful information on this sub-reddit so I thought I would return the favor. We spent a little under two weeks in Naples (+ the Amalfi Coast, Salerno, Pompeii), Venice, and Rome in late July with two adults and two young boys. We are not generally big planners, we arrived only having booked our first few nights' accommodation in Naples and knowing when we had to fly out of Rome.

General travel tips:

(0) We travelled with one backpack per adult (25-35L) plus one RyanAir-sized roller carry-on each for all the kids' stuff. (We consolidated to two backpacks several times, leaving the carry-ons in luggage storage). Often cheaper just outside railway stations rather than inside, your hosts if you are using BnBs will often be willing to hold on to luggage if you ask nicely. Bags with wheels are a huge pain in Venice and in the towns of the Amalfi Coast, and a mild pain on public transport in Rome and Naples. If I learned anything, it's that I could feasibly one-bag for myself + two young kids indefinitely (at least in summer temperatures!) doing sink laundry.

(1) Italo (the high-speed railway co) offers good discounts if you are booking in advance (I believe the Famiglia offer = kids travel free), but such tickets are generally non-refundable/non-changeable. I booked these about a week in advance (Naples->Venice, Venice->Rome), less than 100 EUR each. Note that we sometimes found that train platforms were announced/changed very late (5-10 mins before boarding), so it helps to be at the information board, oriented to where the platforms are and prepared for a quick jog in some instances.

(2) You should even book regional train tickets and ferries in advance if at all possible. We generally did not and it worked fine - until it didn't (see below at Salerno). I think 2-3 days should be sufficient unless it is a peak day (weekend during high season?).

(3) Book in advance as much as possible for the key sights (search this sub for city-specific stuff, I can tell you about Rome and Venice below) because you will pay through the nose if you need to purchase those tickets through a third-party agency. (It may still be worth it but we saw a lot of people very grumpy about having paid 5x or 10x the entry cost, and saw some issues where people had missed the meeting point, ran late etc., and were out hundreds of Euros or more.)

(4) If you are eating at a train station, ask the cafe/restaurant employee about bathrooms: in Naples and in Venice both we found that they gave us a key to some less busy/cleaner bathrooms than the public toilets (where you generally pay 1 EUR for access - sometimes you can tap a credit card).

(5) The food was generally quite good everywhere we went, whether touristy or a local joint, but your kids may or may not agree, esp if their tastes are heavily based on your home versions of bolognese or pizza. We found it occasionally useful to ask for pasta in bianco (""white pasta""), which is just olive oil and pasta, usually offered with Parmesan, they will generally charge it at the lowest-priced pasta dish. 

Some things we learned:

**Naples**

I really enjoyed 3-4 nights here; Naples is a bit chaotic if you are primarily used to Northern Europe/the US but if you have developing-country travel experience, you will be fine with the traffic, crossing roads etc. We found it easy to eat and shop affordably etc; we stayed a few blocks from the main train station and that was very convenient. 

(1) From the Naples airport, the drivers in the taxi-cab queue did not seem interested in taking fares at the fixed-price. I didn't much feel like negotiating because I knew the shared cabs are close-by: hardly any wait at all and 5 EUR per person to Napoli Centrale.

(2) The kids really enjoyed an underground tour (Napoli Sotterennea), though I think there are others offering similar things. It is worth booking this a few hours ahead of time to save yourself a potential wait, though there is plenty to do if you have to wait an hour.

(3) Pompeii is hot during the day but not unmanageable, no advance booking necessary. We ended up deciding to go late and spent 3 or 4 hours wandering around, I think early morning would have been fine too. It is true it is mostly exposed but there is some shade and a few places to sit to rest if you need. Bathrooms a bit inconveniently located and the one by the forum was shut down altogether, so be attentive if you need. The Rick Steves (free) audio-guide was good entertainment for the kids. It helps to know a little history before you go (plenty of kids' books about Pompeii, check out the I Survived series, the Magic Tree House one, or the Paninis of Pompeii). We had spent the morning at the Archeological Museum in Naples which pairs well with this, you can do them on separate days and in any order, obviously. (I think Hercaluneum would have been a very feasible alternative, but there's something to be said for the sheer scale of Pompeii.)

Re: travel logistics, the Circumvesuviana is cheap and convenient, get off at Pompeii Scavi. If you are walking through the site one way, you can exit at the other end (by the amphitheater) and catch the train back from Pompeii Santuario or Pompeii. (We did the latter after a nice meal and some gelato; the church is very pretty!)

(4) We mostly took the subway (you can tap in/out with any NFC credit card or phone, one per person) and walked, and took the occasional taxi. We negotiated the rate with drivers before every ride: pretty uniformly, they asked for 20 EUR for a 10 minute ride and accepted 15 without hesitating, so I suspect the locals probably pay closer to 10. If you use Google Maps, I believe it shows you a fare estimate from FREENOW if that helps you get a sense of the price range - we offered a few euros above this. I always thought it a fair deal, don't hesitate to hop in one esp. if it's hot! (It is also an experience to be in Naples traffic yourself, very glad I didn't drive here!)

**Amalfi/Salerno**

Italian friends suggested we not go at all, and I can see why: Positano (especially) but all the coastal towns we visited (Amalfi, Minori) were very congested and expensive. I didn't find it overwhelming for the most part but I can see why it would be off-putting if it was your main experience (and paying high-season prices!).

(1) Getting there from Naples: we decided to spend a day in Ischia, so we took the earliest morning ferry (didn't book in advance though it would have saved a bit of queuing if I had bought them electronically that morning - use FerryHopper or FerriesDirect to search schedules then book directly on the providers' website) there and left our bags near the port to wander around. Well worth the trip, the Castello Aragonese was a big hit with the kids as was the beach and the food. It was busy but not overwhelming, mostly Italian tourists. It is a long walk to the castle from the port (30 mins?) and we took a cab back to catch the ferry to Amalfi. The island is large enough to spend a couple of days on easily.

(2) Some of the ferries (esp. late evening) did seem to sell out, so if any of your travel relies on it, I would simply book them a few days ahead of time esp if it will be a peak travel day.

(3) We stayed in Bomerano/Agerola, not very far from Amalfi as the crow flies but a very long and windy bus drive. The SITA busses were super-crowded. Drivers did not always have tickets (so buy them in advance - the app is broken but at the Amalfi terminal, you'll find some employees floating around selling them; otherwise, you'll often find they are sold in small convenience stores/tobacconists etc.) + arrive 10-15 mins before the scheduled departure time (if you are at the origin) to ensure you get a seat. We saw people get left behind because they hadn't pre-purchased tickets and people get passed by on the road because there was no room to stop for them: we did not always find seats and often started our trips standing in the aisle. Probably the least fun transit experience of our time in Italy (mostly because of how car-sick my kids got).

(4) The advantage of Agerola (besides being cheaper, quiet, and very pretty!) is that it is right next to the trail-head for the Path of the Gods hike (Sentiero degli Dei). It is not that challenging, I would say easy/moderate w/ kids, well-sign-posted, but worth starting early: we got up at 6AM, were at the trailhead by 7AM, at Nocelle by around 10AM, and then in Positano around noon - including lots of breaks for snacks etc. and a panini + lemonade in Nocelle. The stairs down to the main road were not brutal but I was amazed to see people going uphill (and invariably giving up when they got to Nocelle) - my kids counted to about 1200 steps, there could easily be 2000 altogether. The last 1km along the road to Positano isn't much fun. Definitely walk it this way! I'm glad we did this one early. FWIW (having trekked on all the continents except Antarctica), it's a pretty enough hike but it's basically just a shepherds' path with nice views of Positano, the name and some of the stuff you read about it online is way over-hyped. (There's a little stop just before Nocelle with a lemonade stand in a cave; the father and son that own it are very sweet, I recommend the slight detour!). 

(5) Positano was nice though much prettier from far away (ferry + hike) than close-up. It was probably the most congested place we visited in Italy besides the sights in Rome. Entertaining tourist-watching for sure (moped accidents galore), and window-shopping if you like that sort of thing: it is a bit quieter on the outskirts and higher up if you're willing to walk. I'm glad we only spent an afternoon there, it may be calmer at night once the day-trippers leave. The restaurants were fine, if a bit pricy. I'm glad we did not pay to stay here. The kids splashed around on the (tiny) pebbled free beach for a bit before we caught a ferry back to Amalfi. (And again the dreaded bus-ride back to Agerola!). 

(6) We seriously considered walking down to Praiano with our backpacks from Agerola just to avoid the bus, but slept in after our long day, and in any case, I'm not sure we could have taken a boat from Praiano elsewhere (possibly a water-taxi?). We were lucky the kids got seats on the way down but they still nearly threw up - we hopped off 10 mins from Amalfi and walked.

(7) We had time to kill before making it to Salerno so took a chance on taking a short ferry ride to Minori to spend the afternoon after lunch in Amalfi. Much smaller, cheaper and far less busy, the kids had more room to play on the beach (shady, thanks to the tall cliffs!), the locals and tourists all seemed less harried. I can see why a lot of people recommend it (and Maiori) as a base rather than Positano/Amalfi, it's an excellent idea.

(8) Finally, we took one of the evening boats from Minori to Salerno. Taking a ferry at sunset is a nice way of seeing the coast (indeed, some of the best views we got were from the boats!). Note there are two ports in Salerno (not very far apart but it may matter for you!). We really enjoyed the town and can also imagine having used it as a base to explore the Amalfi coast; a little like Naples in having big city energy and amenities (sushi, grocery stores open later, etc.) but more laid-back and with plenty of interesting historical sights and some sandy beaches (not sure the water was all that clean...).

(9) **One of my big screw-ups was waiting too long to book a regional train ticket** (Salerno->Paestum), which was available the night before but sold out the morning of. (I had wanted some flexibility about taking the 1st vs 2nd train, but wish we had just booked it!) - so book in advance if at all possible! We gave up on it and simply lounged in a cafe until taking a train back to Naples to spend a few hours at the Royal Palace before picking up our suitcases and catching the evening train to Venice. Call at least a day or more ahead if you want to book a tour of one of the Campania dairies (we called Tenuto Vannulo, which runs English tours before noon on demand - but not at the same time every day!). If you are not driving, you should probably WhatsApp some local taxi drivers to pre-arrange transfers b/w the dairies and ruins. (If we had had an extra 2 days or so, I would have considered renting a car and spending some time in Cilento, seems like having a car becomes more important as you get south of Salerno).

**Venice**

Not really our style to fling ourselves around so much, but I thought the kids would really enjoy seeing something so different (we were right!). The train was only 5 hours from Naples and we took it during the hottest part of the day when we would have been resting anyway. Yes, the crowds are bad around St Mark's Square but you only have to walk away 5 minutes before you'll find you have whole streets and canals to yourself.

(1) **Book in advance for St Mark's Basilica** (if you want to go, that is)! I didn't and regretted it, we tried our luck in the line and it closed before we got in. If you are going to the Doge's Palace (which is terrific!), I recommend the Venice City Pass (esp. if you have kids, I think all the adults get ""child"" pricing on a family ticket). It costs slightly more than simply pre-booking the palace (which requires committing to an entry window, I'm not sure how well-enforced it is) but you can walk in any time (no reservation necessary, even if the timed-tickets are sold out!) + you get access to another dozen or so museums, inc some in Murano and Burano. (We only went to a few but the flexible entry to the palace alone was worth it!).

(2) Not sure if a gondola ride is worth it tbh, but if your kids are over 5, check out RowVenice; you can get a family rowing lesson (in the evenings, in the Grand Canal!). It is more expensive than a gondola ride but much longer (1.5 hours instead of 0.5) and of course you and the kids are doing the rowing yourself, so far more interesting and interactive. It was one of the highlights of the trip for the kids.

(3) Other than that, we mostly just enjoyed walking around and exploring (lots of free art exhibitions and of course the Biennale pavilions), inc. a morning in Murano to see a glass-blowing demonstration and pick up some small souvenirs for the kids. See if a single or multi-day vaporetto pass is worth it, we got our money's worth out of a one-day and wish we'd gotten the 2 or 3-day instead of walking so much. **Validate your tickets** (this is true on trains + busses everywhere we travelled) but Venice was the only place we saw tourists paying large fines (min: 50 EUR) on the spot multiple times. The vaporetto does stop at the train station so you can totally use it if you are traveling light enough to get in/out.

(4) We had a perfectly adequate en-suite room in a shared apartment for \~150EUR a night. We hadn't really considered staying on the mainland and day-tripping in, but I think it's worth sucking it up and paying to stay in Venice proper.

**Rome**

(1) **Book in advance (at least the following): the Colosseum/Forum, Villa Borghese and Vatican Museums**. There's probably more that I'm missing. They all open up and seem to sell out weeks in advance. (We were able to get tickets to the first two directly from their websites a week in advance and both were sold out the day of.) Note that for ""free"" kids tickets you may be directed to pick them up from a special ticket counter, so that is why you may not be able to book them online (this was true for Colosseum + Pompeii I believe). We ended up using a third party on Tiqets or GetYourGuide for the Vatican Museums, which worked fine - but it cost 180 EUR instead of what would have been 50 or so if we had booked it directly.) I think they do a fine job: they basically meet you at a designated-meeting-point and escort you in (alongside other people who have ""official"" pre-booked tickets) and then - unless you have booked a tour-guide - you are on your own.  

(2) The Colosseum was overwhelmingly busy, and in fact there was no respite from the crowd at any point inside: this was the earliest entry time on a weekday in late July, and it got hot very quickly. I don't think I can really recommend it, even though the kids were excited to see where gladiators fought. We didn't end up going to the Forum/Palatine Hill etc. at all because it had gotten so warm by late morning (as an adult I could have handled it and was interested, but not sure the kids would have enjoyed it all that much).

(3) The Villa Borghese was great, good afternoon activity (the visits are two hours which is plenty with kids) and, even when sold-out, didn't feel overwhelmingly crowded. There is a special kids tour but only in Italian - but it is small and manageable enough that you can talk your kids through a lot of it (if you know something about art and sculpture i.e.). 

(4) Nearby is the Capuchin Crypt (which has a terrific free audio-guide aimed at kids!), though you might want to warn the kids if they might be creeped out by human skeletal remains. We just walked in, though you can book a specific time online (they did not seem to be punctilious about this).

(5) The kids museum (Explora) is very nice, inexpensive and a break from the heat. Note that it opens in two-hour sessions, you need a timed ticket to get in and you will be asked to leave before the next cohort enters. Our kids also liked the interactive da Vinci museum (we've previously seen a traveling version of the same exhibits).

(6) The Vatican: as I said above, far preferable to get it done yourself but easily worth the ""inflated"" price we paid to get in as early as we did (8am on a Monday). Super busy but most people seem to be effectively on a conveyor belt rushing to the Sistine Chapel, a lot of the other galleries were much less busy (the contemporary art ones almost entirely empty, even though there are some really lovely pieces there). There is also a (cheap) audio-guide for kids that takes about 2 hours, and covers some of the highlights in the collection (Raphael, quite a few Egyptian objects, some sculptures and maps, and of course the Sistine Chapel). Surprisingly, the food and drinks at the cafe are quite reasonably-priced if you need a break. I believe if you book a guided tour that includes St. Peter's, there is a passageway directly from the Sistine Chapel to St Peter's only for those on such tours - this is probably worth paying for (esp. if you are already paying a premium for third-party skip-the-line tickets), because otherwise going to St Peter's Basilica requires exiting the museums, walking about 10-15 minutes and then standing in another (potentially massive!) line - when we went, it was at least an hour's wait if not longer, so we ended up not entering.

ItalyTravel,"My boyfriend and I are traveling to Italy for the first time and we couldn’t be more excited! We’re looking forward to seeing the main attractions, eat A LOT and enjoy the culture.

This is the itinerary we have planned so far:

- Sept 6-8: Fly into Rome from Toronto (AM), go see the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, etc. (Note: we will not be seeing Vatican City)
- Sept 8-11: Take the train to Florence (AM), go see some museums, Basilica
- Sept 11-13: Take the train from Florence to Milan/Lake Como (AM) and spend a few days there
- Sept 13-15: Take a train from Milan to Cinque Terre and spend a day or 2 sight-seeing
- Sept 15-17: Take a train from Cinque Terre to Rome (and then fly out to Toronto the morning of Sept 17)

Milan/Lake Como is a bit of a non-negotiable so if we do have to sacrifice Cinque Terre we’re open to this suggestion and then we’ll maybe stay an extra day in Florence to go to Tuscany and another extra day in either Rome or Milan.

ItalyTravel,"I used to have one of those DYI toilet-seat attachments that turns a regular toilet into a Japanese-style all-in-one, and I thought it was the greatest thing (until the hot water connection blew loose in the middle of the night and flooded my and my downstairs-neighbor’s apartments, but that’s another story).

The toilet-seat attachment had decent water pressure and the nozzle was angled to properly clean one’s self.

Bidets weren’t at the top of my list for my trip to Italy, but I was pretty enthused to have an opportunity to use one again (Landlord made me uninstall the toilet seat attachment after the freak-midnight bidet blowout mentioned above).

I knew that European bidets are a whole separate fixture, and wouldn’t be the same as the Japanese-style toilet-seat attachments. Even with a video from Instagram to explain things, I never quite got the hang of using the ones I encountered in Italy.

I encountered two issues at opposite ends of a spectrum:

1) Low water pressure with the nozzle not angled well. In these situations, the job just didn't seem to get done unless I, like, got in there a bit with my hand. Is that normal? Was I doing it wrong?

2) High water pressure. Having used the Japanese-style toilet-seat attachments, I thought this was how it's supposed to be, basically a power wash. Water would splash everywhere, though, especially if I turned it on before assuming the position over it. That didn't seem quite right. Was *that* normal? What was I doing wrong?

ItalyTravel,"Bringing my wife to Italy for the first time, and this is a pretty big commitment for us.   
 I fell into the common trap - I WANT TO DO IT ALL! Dinners in Bologna and Parma, driving through Tuscany, hiking in the Dolomites, etc. Then I looked at it again in terms of **every itinerary reaction in this sub**, and forced myself to chill. I wouldn't travel like that at home, why do it just because it's Italy?

**Dates:** Sept 8th - Sept 23rd 2024

**Demo:** Two late 20s couple, USA

**Itinerary:** Milan (2 nights) -> Cinque Terre (3) -> Florence (4) -> Bologna (0) -> Venice (1) -> Dolomites (3) -> Milan (1)

**General Notes:**

* **Flights**: We took IcelandAir from IAD. Perfectly fine airline, didn't have a problem with bags after hearing they were strict with carry on sizes even though ours were not hardshell rollers. We had a small layover in Reykjavik. Of course a direct would have been ideal but was kind of nice to stretch our legs and go through EU customs at Reykjavik, after landing in Milan we simply walked out.
* **Food:** Our food experience was fairly good. We had great cicchetti and pizza in Venice, solid ossobuco in Milan, fantastic sandwiches, pizza and seafood in Cinque Terre, really good pasta, steak and sandwhiches in Florence and an awesome pork schnitzel and breakfast in Val Gardena (Dolomites). 
   * All Food Places: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_nw7lxUK1Y3lAW7ygpjCh79u_zRQcXH8j8OR7rlGclo/edit?usp=sharing) 
   * Of course cappuccinos, pastries and Gelato were great almost everywhere. Our favorite Gelato was Sorbettiera in Florence.
* **Lodging:** I regretfully went over budget with our accommodations. I wanted to get a more expensive place in Florence but we were rarely hanging out in the room and it was also kind of far from most things. For future trips, I'm making a note to myself to only do hotels when flying in and flying out. Airbnbs can be hit or miss and the check-in process can be stressful after or before a flight. In addition, I would love to do more B&Bs and agriturismos. We had a great experience at our B&B in the Dolomites.
   * **Lodging Locations:** (✔️ - would stay at location again)
      * Milan: Port Romana ✔️
      * Cinque Terre: Cornigilia ✔️
      * Florence: Piazzale Michelangelo ✖️
      * Venice: San Marco ✔️

Cinque Terre was also pretty special. The towns are so unique and the hikes we did were awesome. However, I'm not sure I would go back. Once was enough in my opinion.

This was my second time to Florence but it's a must see of course. Our best food experiences were in Florence.

ItalyTravel,"I took a train from München to Bologna through the Brenner pass (RJ 83). I recommend people do it once, the route is pretty scenic.

**BOLOGNA (3 days): took an AirBnB near BOLOGNA Centrale**

*Getting around:*

Was mostly walking. If I need to go far away, I bought bus tickets from Muver app (Titolo Urbano BO, 75 minutes validity) and scan with NFC on the first bus for verification when boarding.

*Places:*

1. Forno Brisa Spaccio e Lab (https://maps.app.goo.gl/1zgzVgtmn8gduzdx8) : Really good Focaccia and coffee
2. Trattoria di Via Serra (https://maps.app.goo.gl/jAJq8cAWenfL271o6) : Was lucky enough to get a seat for dinner without reservation. Really good local food and specials. I recommend asking the waiter/waitress.
3. Allegra (https://maps.app.goo.gl/PJ9mBDDNG8rCm7G56) : Speciality coffee and baked items. They have a restaurant which seems amazing, unfortunately did not book beforehand.
4. Scuro (https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8Nc868y4ZtHxoX99) : Cocktail bar (reservation needed). Curious and genius barista. Their cocktails are completely different (have a look at the menu).
5. Ling’s Ravioleria Migrante (https://maps.app.goo.gl/DRKMF1u95umMCeFH7) : Chinese dumpling with a twist (no reservation needed). Have a look near the payment counter and you find chili oil and other stuff to buy.
6. Beirut snack (https://maps.app.goo.gl/SVQud7rtYQx11B8a9) : Recommended by the barista at Scuro. Really good falafel.

Rest was just walking around and checking local places. Took a train from Bologna Centrale to Napoli Centrale (Frecciarossa).

**NAPOLI (3 days): took an AirBnB near NAPOLI Centrale. All spots here were recommendations by locals, no preplanning.**

*Getting around:*

Unico Campania app. Got the Unico Napoli 3 day ticket (UNICO NAPOLI 3 GIORNI INTEGRATO (10.80 €)), usable on any public transport with some exclusions in the Napoli metropolitan area.

*Places:*

1. Ventimetriquadri (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zCX3r6aSaAum4ZnNA) : Small cafe, the oldest speciality coffee place in Napoli. I went there everyday for coffee and talked with the owner. Good breakfast and brunch (all day)
2. Blue Turtle caffetteria (https://maps.app.goo.gl/MuhbjjxNWzioZNP78) : Another speciality cafe with jazz music playing. Recommended by the owner at Ventimetriquadri. I went there everyday for a talk with the owner. No food options, only coffee.
3. Osteria il Pacchero Napoli (https://maps.app.goo.gl/fdipJUEWfT5RMaHs9) : Recommended by the owner of Ventimetriquadri. You want authentic local food, go here. Really nice service.
4. Pizzeria Osteria Manfredi (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gw2B4Nfh6dFom4GZ7) : Recommended by the owner of Blue Turtle. I stick to local pizza options (with friarelli) or the original margherita. Best pizza place for me.
5. Ciro Cascella maestro Pizzaiolo 3.0 (https://maps.app.goo.gl/6dNVJCGSCnGd9Cbv7) : Recommended by the owner of Blue Turtle. Its busy and pretty popular. Good pizza, I stick to options listed in 4.
6. Ceramics of Vietri di Fasano Rosario (https://maps.app.goo.gl/tDeK8GuFvUcqfxj86) : Pottery store. I bought cups and some gifts. I found this place through the owner of Ventimetriquadri.

Some other place where I did not go but were recommendations, Pizzeria e Trattoria al 22 (https://maps.app.goo.gl/PBA8KeA3U3nhvwDg8) and Zero - Healthy Bar & Specialty Coffee (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nq79yvWwGpCfsVmXA).

I used public transport (including funiculars) to explore everything. I would come back here again.

I took an Intercity from Napoli Centrale to Palermo Centrale. Recommendation would be to book a single seat in 2nd class cabin which has a 2+1 layout. The route was scenic along the coast and the train was boarded onto a ship to cross the messina strait. This trip is long, so if you can't sit for long or get bored, do not do this. Bring your own food but there are machines in the same coach I mentioned which give snacks, drinks, and coffee (Bring coins, 5€ or 10€ notes). No wifi on train. I took this trip cause I wanted to see the route. Almost 10 hours. The ship crossing is also a major reason.

**PALERMO (3 days): took an AirBnB near PALERMO Centrale.**

*Getting around:*

Palermobilita app for public transport. Get a 2/3 day ticket (6€/8€) or walk around. I would not walk cause it was humid. Just get ticket and follow instructions on app.

*Places:*

1. Ke Palle (https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNPpqthw9TEE5Aix9) : Arancine and Cannoli. Try anything, I loved it. My favourite were Sicilian Black pork ragout and Swordfish eggplant.
2. Cappadonia Gelati (https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Mmin6gXFb5xD3x39) : Pistachio or almond, favourites. The texture was amazing.
3. Cioccolateria Lorenzo (https://maps.app.goo.gl/dWa7dEA2Uj72rDua9) : Tiramisu, melts in your mouth. Any chocolate drink or any available cakes. Do not miss this place.
4. Osteria Alivàru da Carlo Napoli (https://maps.app.goo.gl/DSL6EpxSDsrLLBM47) : I had the meatballs with sardines and sicilian swordfish pasta, amazing. I did not book, just walked in and they had a seat available.
5. Osteria Pizzeria da Carlo (https://maps.app.goo.gl/w4d9yyREsiL33HXR9) : I again went for friarelli or salmone. Really good pizzas.

No recommended coffee shop here but you can try VERA coffice break (https://maps.app.goo.gl/ADRHvMoGjiovcVTHA).

I did visit local places but could not walk around much even with public transport. This city is different. A lot of places have a different architecture which I would recommned checking out (Chiesa Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, Palazzo dei Normanni, etc).

12 hour intercity to Roma termini. I don't want to say anything else here.

**ROMA (3 days): took an AirBnB easily reachable by metro from ROMA Termini**

*Getting around:*

TicketAppy for public transport. Get the 3 day pass for 18€ (BRM72). You can read where it is usable in the app but it gets you anywhere in Roma and can be used on almost everything except airport line or trenitalia airport connection.

*Places:*

1. Faro - Caffè Specialty (https://maps.app.goo.gl/DhM1njKbVpsTXnWo9) : Speciality coffee and they have their own kitchen for baked items or food. You have to queue if you want a seat or just go inside to the counter to order (if you want to drink and leave). I would recommend it for coffee but it is busy all the time.
2. Sensorio - Specialty Coffee Roasters (https://maps.app.goo.gl/HF7QZfz5HtT6Namy9) : I wish I found this place earlier. It is not busy, the owner is amazing. Good espresso and some snacks on the counter. I bought beans from them. My favourite place for coffee.
3. L'Osteria della Trippa (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zVCNu6n5m4TUi8bK6) : Your local roman food, pretty good. I loved the trippa and amatriciana.
4. Hosteria Grappolo d'oro (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zv4GAk4yW438kX9x6) : Popular place, I was lucky to get a seat withour reservation. I had the tasting menu to try everything. I loved the Boiled beef meatballs and red wine braised beef cheek. Good wine selection. Really nice waiter.
5. Pizza e Mozzarella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/iyU6RXZN4MZR4M8T8) : Quick eats.

I walked around a lot to see whatever I could (Pantheon, St Peters Basilica, Piazza Navona, Trevi fountain, Colosseum, Trajans column, Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore, Castel Sant'Angelo etc). If you want to see cats go to Largo di Torre Argentina. I believe there is a lot of construction going on for the next year's rome jubilee.

I haven't explored everything in Roma. I will be back to try more food and visit other places like the vatican museum and sistine chapel (in vatican, I know). There are some other restaurants I would like to visit.

Took trains back to München.

This trip was exhausting but I did it. I need to rest a bit after so much walking. Hope you find it helpful. I will update if I remember something else and sorry if there are mistakes. If you have questions, feel free to ask. Ciao!",t2_5d9yfsck,"Just came back from 2 week trip to Italy (kinda all over the country).

ItalyTravel,"My two friends and I (all 24M) came back from Rome today, after travelling for 6 days, from 04/09 to 10/09. Newcomers. We've had an absolutely magical trip. I had done a lot of research, reading a bunch here and also on r/rome in order to make sure this rare opportunity for a trip would yield an amazing trip. I'm glad to say that it certainly was! I'll try to give here as many tips as I can, and perhaps help some of y'all feel more at ease.

# Weather

For the longest time before the trip, the forecast showed 5 rainy days out of 6, when 3 of them forecasted to have thunderstorms. This did not happen at all! We had 5 *sunny* days out of 6. It did rain on the first night (but during 3-4 AM, and we were sleeping of course), and then it only rained for \~3 hours on the last day.

The raining night made the day after slightly colder, and city was wet. It looked and felt magical. We saw the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and Roman Forum all wet with a wintery vibe, and of course, there were only a few people. It turned out to be a huge positive. For the whole week, it was very hot with \~33C on average every day, so when the rain made the days colder, it made us happier.

Our tip: don't be sad about the rainy forecasts, because the rain just might not happen. And if it does, it's likely to be short and have long-lasting advantages that will make your trip feel more unique. For the hot days - drink lots of water, and take breaks when possible.

# Pickpocketing

We were glad not to be pickpocketed. I want to say that it is a combination of luck, but mostly preparation. We left our passports at the AirB&B, with pictures of them on our phones. We had our money and cards in a pouch under our shirts, and no other valuables with us. We felt comfortable and safe. And still, whenever we were surrounded by huge and dense crowds (the metro, places like Trevi Fountain and Trastevere, etc), we kept our belongings tight. We recommend you to do the same thing!

# Shopping

There are two (maybe even three?) outlet shopping malls in Castel Romano, south of Rome. One of them is for designer brands, the other one for more common ones (like H&M for example). The prices are nice, and the food in the area is **surprisingly** good. Prices of clothes, jewelry, etc. in the city's center are high (relatively to Europe and the States, for the very least).

# Main attractions

Full experience tickets to the Colosseum can and should be purchased in advance on its official website for 24 EUR each. They include Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum. **Garden of the Oranges** is a beautiful park on top of a hill next to the Colosseum area, and you can get a very nice view of the city's landscape from there. The Pantheon tickets shouldn't be bought in advanced, since the lines are basically non-existent for entry. Should be 5 EUR for the general tourists, and 2 EUR for European citizens / passport holders.

# Vatican

The line for St. Peters was extremely long when we were first there. We were so shocked by its length, that circled the entire piazza, so we just left, promising to leave it to a different day, when we would wake up earlier. Which we did, but the line was just as long. Don't be intimidated! It goes fast, and after \~50 minutes we were already inside. It's not fun to wait under the hot sun, but there's a few shaded areas around.

We also really wanted to see the Vatican Gardens, so we booked a bus tour at 9 AM. We really recommend it! It was lovely and a very nice opening to our Vatican Day. No need to say how beautiful the gardens are, too. I'm pretty sure it's impossible to go inside without a walking tour guide or a bus guide, and the latter is much cheaper (and preferrable in general, IMHO).

# Tivoli

We took a day trip to Tivoli and thank god we did. The town is absolutely gorgeous. The mountains, views and nature are green and pastoral, the buildings are colorful, the cobblestoned curvy paths are beautifully carved, and it's a really amazing place to sit at a restaurant. The river to the east is actually blue (unlike the Tiber) and very pretty. Villa d'Este is probably the most beautiful garden I've ever been to. It has 3 floors of art and history, and a gigantic and beautiful garden outside, with immense fountains and tidy greenery.

# General Tips

• The zoo (Bioparco) in the park of Borghese (near the gallery) should cost 19 EUR per adult, but 9 EUR if you wait until a certain time (for us it was 4 PM). This is because the shows usually stop at that time, and a lot of animals go to sleep. We think it was totally worth it.

• Walk as much as possible. It's difficult for so many reasons - the hot sun and lack of shaded areas, the cobblestones, and the fact that somehow, in a magical way, for every time you go down a hill, you end up going 5 others upwards. These make Rome a hard city to walk in, especially in the summer. But it doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it! We personally think it's the best way to travel. Buses were quite annoying.

# Our personal negative opinions

• After seeing St. Peters, the Sistine Chapel, Villa d'Este, and so many more similar sites. the Pantheon felt pretty underwhelming for us. It's small and very crowded. We think its uniqueness is from the outside, which is free anyway. We're not necessarily saying to skip it (especially not for first timers).

• We didn't like the 'Botanical Garden of Rome'. We had hoped to get a Central Park kind of vibe, but the park was small, the pathways were muddy, and we didn't see anything interesting. Names on its map like Butterfly Garden and the Japanese Gardens had piqued our interest, but we quickly found out that the former has nothing to do with colorful butterflys flying around, and that the latter is just a small Japanese-style cabin with a small zen lake. Everything else was basically mud and ferns. We think the nice gardens of Rome and nearby are near Galleria Borghese, the Vatican Gardens, and Tivoli's Villa d'Este of course.

• We saw a young girl having an extremely unpleasant experience with a mentally ill woman who seemed to be a local. They fought in Italian so we have no idea what they said, but it looks like the young girl was patient and respectful. The older woman gave her the most horrible slap I've ever seen. It sounded and looked terrifying, and the girl was super embarrassed, crying. We felt so bad for her. Her boyfriend got really mad and tried to protect her, but the older woman went crazy, acting like a battering ram against the boyfriend, pushing him with her head. It was really scary. My point is - be super careful. Especially on buses, especially at night, especially on the weekend.

Hope you enjoy Rome as much as we did!

ItalyTravel,"Here is the tl:Dr - We did so much that now that we are home we have forgotten how to do things without the constant running schedule. Just how we like vacations, personally. It's a beautiful country with amazing food and we hope to return. I've included my final step count and the temperature for each day. I am worn. OUT. 

Despite the warnings of this reddit, we decided to squeeze as MUCH into the vacation as we could. Naples was cleaner than Rome I think. Rome and Venice won for most places to get water by like..... a lot. Naples had some of the best food. Everywhere was crowded except for some of the more exclusive tours. While walking was the best way to get around pretty much everywhere, other transportation we used: Bus (local and long distance), train (both high speed and local), funicular, subway/metro, uber, taxi, vaporetto(water taxi), gondola, ferry, Ski lift, Cable car...

Naples drivers seemed to view traffic lights as a joke. They got progressively more likely to follow \*any\*kind of traffic laws the farther north we went. 

Day 1 was just a travel day. We left St Louis, MO at 11 am central and after stops in Chicago and Frankfurt, ended up in Naples at noon the next day having skipped forward 7 hours. 

Day 2, Friday August 9th - Naples. We went to the airbnb (host was super annoyed that we were planning to take public transport and then ended up on a taxi because it was too crowded). Location of the airbnb was amazing - right next to the tallest bell tower in the city and at the center of all of the action) We changed clothes and took a wander to the beach, stopping along the way for a pizza fritta. (we intended Mappatella but didn't get quite that far and just went with a spot where a bunch of locals were.) Then we hiked on to 50 Kalo (Michelin Recommended and delicious) for some dinner. *27,720 steps, 91 degrees* By the end of the day the tendon in the side of my foot was very irritated and swollen. 

Day 3, Saturday, August 10th - Naples. We started the day by a trip to the ATM, grocery store, and to get coffee at a place called Its. Then we had a foodie walking tour where we got to try SO MUCH delicious food and hear about the interesting highlights of the city as told by a local. After that we did a tour of Bourbon Gallery, and then after a short nap, dinner at ~La Lolanda Gesu Vechhio (Michelin Bib Gourmand. also delicious)~ *28,926 steps 99 degrees*

~Day 4, Sunday, August 11th - Pompeii and Vesuvius after a quick bite at Moscati we took the train to pompeii, where we did a short self-guided audiotour. Then we had a bus to Vesuvius, which we hiked at the hottest part of the day, and I tweaked my knee on the opposite side of the already hurt foot. The view was worth it. After the trip we had cuoppo di mare at a street side shop.~  *26,710 steps 99 degrees* 

Day 5, Monday, August 12th - Travel day and Rome. We took a train to Rome and after checking into our airbnb, which was pretty close to the train station, we went back to the central market at the train station for Tripizzina and a sandwich and a fried artichoke. We made the trip across town to the spanish steps for  a waking tour of Rome for which the tour guide NEVER SHOWED UP. ANd then the tour company tried to gaslight me into believing she did show up and we were just late even though we were actually early and the rest of the people there were also unsure why there was no guide who ever showed up. Since she never got there we found a self-directed walking tour and went to all the places ourselves, including some stops that were not on the original list (like an aquaduct that feeds the Trevi). We attempted to go to the cat rescue but were too late (or so we thought... turns out they were closed for the week) After that we took a nap and then went to Restaurant All'Oro (Michelin Starred and very unique) *24,125 steps 97 degrees*

Day 6, Tuesday August 13th - Rome took a taxi to Vatican City for a tour, which was lovely, though the sistine chapel was packed, as expected. The wait for the Duomo at St Mark's was 1 hour 45 minutes and I didn't realize exactly what I was signing up for but ultimately enjoyed myself. We then had a late lunch at All'Antico Vinaio. Then we did the Pantheon tour. After that we had aperitivo on the walk back to the airbnb and then had gelato for dinner. *21,369 steps 95 degrees*

Day 7, Wednesday, August 14th - Rome Coliseum day - We grabbed some breakfast at Forno Conti & Co on the way to the Colesium, where we had tickets to the attic. It was amazing, We were almost completely alone for that whole part of the experience. After that we toured the rest of the colesium and then went to the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, where at one point a seagull landed inches from my fiancee while he was taking pictures (my fiancee, not the gull) so we took far far too many pictures of a friendly bird. Then we stopped back by the cat sanctuary where we found out they were closed for deep cleaning. So we made our way to trastevere neighborhood for the Tripizzini main store and then to Olateg for Gelato. By then it was time to make our way back to near the spanish steps for our cooking class. We made Carbonara and some kind of pasta with red sauce and tiramisu. On the walk back to the airbnb we stopped back at the Trevi and I got a lemon full of lemon gelato *30,917 steps 95 degrees* 

Day 8, Thursday, August 15th - Travel day to Venice. After our train ride we checked into our airbnb just 2 bridges away from the train station. We walked across to St Mark's square, doing an audiotour on the way (which is how we learned about Boobs bridge) We tried to pet some cats at Liberia Acqua Alta but there were WAY TOO MANY instagram girlies there and the cats were hiding. The St Mark's tour was very cool, especially the roof! We went back across town to the Jewish Ghetto for a chicetti and spritz tour. *24,728 steps 90 degrees*

Day 9, Friday, August 16th - Venice - My fiancee's birthday! We started the day going downstairs from our airbnb to Majer for a cake that I had ordered (It ended up not being ready until 16:00 though) so we grabbed some pastries and headed our for our Murano and Burano tour. The tour was really nice because we got to see some glasblowing and lacemaking (hand making lace is a literally dying art - all of the masters are in their 70s) We had some gelato there. When we got back we went to the sunken crypt of zaccaria. We went back acorss town for late lunch of pasta/risotto at the place downstairs next door to our airbnb and to pcik up the cake. Then after a nap we went to Quadri (Michelin Starred, but not great) for dinner. *19,791 steps 91 degrees*

Day 10, Saturday, August 17th  Cortina d'ampezzo - We took a bus to Marco Polo airport and then another bus to Cortina D'ampezzo, where we took a cable car, then a ski lift to have lunch on the top of a mountain (so close to the border that the menu was in German, English, and Italian). We hiked the trail back to the cable car and then took it back down to the village. From there we took the worst bus ride (Instead of being from 5:10 to 8:20 it was from 5:20 to 9:45. There were people assigned to rows 7 and 8 and there just ....weren't... rows 7 or 8.  And the woman who got off the bus at the airport from the seats where we were actaully assigned left her fanny pack with her passport in it, which we gave to the driver and his response was like ""hmmm what do you want me to do about it""?) When we got back to town we were worn out so we had cake and gelato for dinner. *23,122 steps 90 degrees*

Day 11, Monday, August 18th, Transfer to Milan. Other than some somewhat insistent rose and bracelet sellers, this was our only day we saw pickpockets. The people in front of us getting on the train had very nice louis vuitton luggage and the Italo train employee pointed to a man helping them with their luggage and yelled that he was a pickpocket. He ran off the train emptyhanded. Once we got to Milan we put our luggage into storage and then went to the Duomo (Again with an amazing rooftop!) after some more walking around in the light rain, and a lunch from McDonald's of all places, then we went back to get our luggage and then checked into the airbnb. After a short nap, we had dinner at the central market at the train station. *20,683 steps 82 degrees*

Day 12, Tuesday, August 19th - Como - We started out the day with a train to Lake Como, which started with a walking tour of the town of Como, then an hour long boat ride on the lake, then a Funicular ride up the mountain, then lunch at a pasta restaurant and gelato. Then we got on the wrong train coming back but still made it back in time to take a short nap before changing for dinner. Dinner was at L'Alchemia (our last Michelin Starred place of the trip, which was delicious) *15,970 steps 88 degrees* 

 Day 13, Wednesday, August 20th - Milan and travel - We started the day with a quick taxi ride to see the Last Supper . It was breathtaking. Then a walk back to get our luggage and a train ride to the airport. *16,057 steps*

We went to the beach for about two hours and when we came back we found someone went through all of our stuff and stole all the money we had. It seems the intruder used a key to get in so we suspect it was someone from within the agency that used a duplicate key, and after the robbery we also noticed that the other lock now works correctly, so it seems they used some kind of lock blocker before and removed it after they did the deed.

ItalyTravel,"I'm writing this post to provide some perspective on the whole ""OMG Italy is so scammy, there are pickpockets everwhere..."" trend that I'm seeing both here and in r/rome. So i crunched some numbers.

In 2019 there where **220.662.000 tourists in Italy** (rounded, and yes 200 millions) let's say that 99% of those never experience anything bad that leave just **1%** of tourist that are scammed/robbed. It would be a whooping 2.206.620 tourist. Yep two million tourist robbed? It would make the news! But maybe there is some kind of coverup...  
Let's imagine that of those two million victim of crime 1% are redditors. So we have 22.066 angry redditors per year! Let's imagine that of those just 50% will write a post here.

11.033 post about pickpocket per year. That's around 30 post per day each day of the year.

Since there are less than that we can conclude that the % of tourist that are scammed/robbed is **less than 1%.** Pretty great.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone, I’ve recently travelled to Rome, Florence, Verona, and Milan in early October and I had the time of my life. Here are my observations!

Rome
We spent 6 nights in Rome and went to the Pantheon, Colosseum/Roman Forum/Palantine Hill, St Peter’s Basilica, Vatican museums, Galleria Borghese, and took a day trip to Pompeii. We also explored Trastevere for a day, and walked into buildings, churches, alleyways. I loved Rome so much, I couldn’t believe I was there! I was surprised with how many tourists were there though, which sounds so silly coming from a tourist like myself. Also, we walked everywhere - the city is so walkable. All in all, I loved it! 9/10 only because I did end up getting sick on day 4 and I found some of the pharmacists a bit rude when I was asking for specific medication (which isn’t the city’s fault though!).

Florence
We spent 4 nights in Florence and went to the Uffizi and Statue of David. I planned to walk up Bruschellini’s dome but my calves were so sore (I have some sort of muscle strain/calf condition) so thought it best to skip this and instead enjoy more of Florence rather than potentially injure myself. Wow, the city is INSANE! The beautiful river, the bridges, the piazzale Michelangelo, the leather, jewellery, the FOOD, the art. The sunset was beautiful, as was the reflection of the lights and buildings against the river. I felt so happy here and was so sad to leave. Would come back again 10/10.

Verona
Spent two days here, didn’t book any attractions here. We walked through the city and explored all alleyways. It was so CUTE! We went to Juliet’s balcony, inside some random churches, walked up to the Castel San Pietro lookout, explored the Castelvecchio bridge and museum. It was a romantic town and the colours of the buildings were vibrant. 10/10, would come back again.

Milan
We only stayed one night here so we could easily catch a flight to London. I’ve heard and read that people do not like Milan, so I had very low expectations. I did like it, only because we booked the terraces ticket for the Duomo. It was beautiful, so intricate. My brain cannot comprehend the work and artistry that went into it. We also explored the castle and walked through the gardens, however, felt unsafe as we did so in the dark (it was only 6pm though) and there were groups of people scattered all across the park talking to and harassing passer-by’s. So that felt a little off to me, although there was no actual threat. I wouldn’t come back to Milan except for any connections to my next destination, 6/10.

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! I also read that Europeans (yes it’s a generalisation I know) are rude. However, the Italians were the nicest people we had met! So warm, welcoming, and always happy to help!

A few observations:  
1) Italians absolutely adore babies. So many times during meals, servers and people around kept our 18 month old entertained so we could eat in peace.  
2) Most baby chairs in Italy DO NOT have belts. It was a little difficult to keep our highly social kid in his seat. :')  
3) Baby cribs/playpens are bigger than what we are used to. All our hotels had mattresses and pillows for cribs which atleast for us has never been the case in the US.  
4) Trains are just awesome. Take the train if there is one wherever you are going.  
5) Read the countless posts on this sub about taxis. If you know what you are doing, you will be just fine. We took a taxi from Naples ferry terminal to the train station, did not ask about fare. I just handed the driver 13EUR after the ride and he was on his way. Thanks to this sub I had the rate card on my phone.  
6) I can't stop thinking about the gelatos, the aperols and the cappuccinos.   
7) Nothing that you see will be captured in all it's glory in your phone's camera. The country is so stunning you just can't capture the beauty on your phone. 

We enjoyed the food, the scenery and the architecture and will definitely be back! Arrivederci Italia!",t2_iaq95cf2,"Thank you! Trip to Venice, Florence, Amalfi Coast and Rome.",0.93,22,1729527408.0,1729527408.0,7,EconomicsActual4084,1g8tms6
ItalyTravel,"Hi, I'm an 18yr old M from Australia in Milan at the start of my month long trip through Italy. My two friends and I are going to Milan, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Naples, Amalfi and then Rome. In my short time in Milan, I've found that people cam be quite judgemental of my friends and I (not to say I haven't had some wonderful interactions with locals), and we are quite quiet and try to be respectful. We have done our utmost to speak Italian where possible and still try to learn more everyday to allow the locals to speak their own language in their own city, yet we still get dirty looks or some people laughing behind our backs, I'm wondering if this is especially common in Milan, or if it's just a tourist thing, please let me know, thanks",t2_c1j8ubv6,How tourist friendly are Italian towns,0.63,21,1725568345.0,1725568345.0,94,-SpearAUS-,1f9wok8
ItalyTravel,"Hi there,

I am currently visiting Italy by car with my GF and I am wondering about the speedlimits. Quite often we get honked at, high-beams or really close following traffic when abiding speed-limits. Usually we drive 60 in a 50 zone - yet still, we get all of the symptoms above. Why is that? Why do so many Italian drivers not abide their own speed limits? To me as a foreigner, the least I can do is to follow the rules and laws, right?

Worst experience so far has been a truck/lorry driver on the autostrada: due to construction there was a limit of 60 kph, which we were abiding (going 65 ish). The lorry came from behind, flashing lights, horn, everything. Finally he overtook us. Once the limits was lifted, we accelerated to 130 kph and overtook him. When we reached the cab of the lorry, the driver intentionally swerved to the left, forcing an emergency brake on us, to avide colliding with the guard rail. 

Is this just normal for tuscany?

ItalyTravel,"First of all, thank you very much for all the tips shared in this sub, i feel like our trip was well planned and organised, as well as very enjoyable thanks to all the information we read in this sub :)

We come from Vienna, 26F and 30M, so the trip might sound exhausting (it was), but we hadn't had real vacations for a long time so we really tried to do and experience a lot, and we did!!

Rome (4 nights)

We stayed at Palazzo Sant'Antonio, about 15 mins walk from metro station Cornelia. The good thing about staying outside the center is that its much cheaper, both the hotel costs, and also at the cafes and gelateria, everything is half the price of what it costs in the center. For example, in Tiramisu Pasticceria in via Aurelia, we had 2 croissants, 2 mini croissants, and 1 coffee for 6 euros. And theyre delicious. One busy morning, we got to see so many people came in and out the cafe, very loud, chaotic, but happy, and it felt like watching a movie :D Downside is ofc it takes at least 40 mins to go anywhere.
I'd been to Rome before but my bf hadn't, so we visited the usual Colloseum, Pantheon, Vatican, etc. The Vatican museum got very much crowded, never been in a room so full of people, and so different compared to 5+ years ago when I last visited. I think it was the least enjoyable attraction that we visited. Also we used all the Rick Steves audio tours, its free and very easy to use!!
All in all, it was a very nice experience, despite the heat and the chaos, I will always revisit Rome. We saw at least once a day pickpocketers in action, they are there but i agree its not that bad when you are being cautious. One quick eating place, Pomodorum in via Cavour, was our favorite place to eat, we went there 4x in our trip!! I would even say food we had in restaurants were never as good as what we had there.
There's so much more to write but lets move on!

from this on, we rented a car from Centauro (directly on their website to get premium package), was super easy and cheap (we rented for 9 days for 315 euro, full protection with no excess)!

Castel Gandolfo (1 night)

Stayed at Atlantis Inn Castel Gandolfo, the best room we had in the whole trip!! It was a perfect recovery stop after busy days in Rome. The town is very pretty, and it was a nice drive going down the lake. Would come back!!

Gaeta (short beach stop)

We were not sure about this stop because our next hotel was in Ceprano (1 hr away by car) but we were feeling fit so we went here anyway. It was really great!! We thought we didn't need to swim at the beach because its gonna be costly (we read the 40 euro for one beach bed thing) but it was so easy and not expensive! its a beautiful sandy beach, not crowded at all, paid only 7 euro for the umbrella, and really enjoyed swimming there. The town itself looked empty in the afternoon but we didn't mind. The view from the church up the hill was amazing! Downside: there's not much lunch option there.

Ceprano (1 night)

Stayed at Agriturismo Ciociaro il Colle, it was just a stop to sleep but it was a really nice place to stay. We got to see some farm animals, the view was beautiful, the drive from Gaeta to Ceprano was serpentine and my bf really enjoyed driving there. And the dinner!! 10 course meal for 22 euro. A bottle of wine for 2.5 euro. It was a lot. But we really enjoyed it. I think we had the best mozarella we've ever had there. We were also quite amazed at how locals there could eat so much and so quickly.  So grateful with the experience!!

Napoli (1 night)

Stayed at Terra Mia B&B (the best host we've had). Napoli was so chaotic, I'm not sure if I loved it but it was definitely a nice thing to have experienced. The day we visited, at one point we tried to go home and 3 metro/funicular stations were closed, its not well announced like eg Spagna station closure in Rome, even gmaps told us to go there, we gave up and took the taxi (that stopped in front of the metro station, no driver accepted our request on FreeNow or Uber) instead (funny cos first the driver said itd be 20 euro, we agreed but the whole journey i looked definitely pissed and he said its a special price today so its 15 euro, which is what the normal price on the app suggests). But yeah, food was amazing there. Maybe we'll come again :)

Vesuvius & Pompeii (1 night)

Yes, we hiked Vesuvius and visited Pompeii on the same day. Yes, it was exhausting, but we loved it and would not do anything different. Again, thanks to Rick Steves audio tour!
We stayed in Bellevue Herculaneum B&B, had a real nice sunset view while eating rotisserie chicken from some small vendor outside our room. Too bad we didn't visit Herculaneum archaeological park, but maybe next time!

Sorrento & Amalfi Coast (2 nights)

Stayed at Agriturismo Le Grottelle in Sorrento, it's a bit far from the center but worth the ambience and cheaper price! The dinner there was also one of the best we had, 1 kg steak for 50 euro (we ordered 500gr for 2)!! and again, we enjoyed a very beautiful sunset there!
We rented a vespa there, drove to Positano, Amalfi, and Ravello on the first day. It was amazing. Not as hard as people said. The traffic where the buses meet were not that frequent. But damn, it was amazing. We stopped at Positano and Ravello for photos, gelato, and just walking around.
On the second day, we went with a boat tour to Positano and Amalfi, where we had a longer time to explore Amalfi. Amalfi was smaller than we thought. We also swam at Positano beach, the free one part, where its so crowded and we were anxious the whole time that our stuff would be stolen, but fortunately nothing happened. 

Lago San Vincenzo, Molise (1 night)

Again, another recovery day at the lake stop. After 2 busy days, we enjoyed just laying on our sunbeds and swam at the lake. It's beautiful and we saw no tourists there.


Vasto (1 night)

I wish we stayed longer!!
We started having Brodetto alla Vastese for lunch and personally it was the best meal I had in this trip. The people there are so nice! and we ofc spent another day just laying on our sunbeds and swam at the beach. We paid 15 euro for an umbrella and 2 sunbeds, not expensive at all! The town was pretty both during the day and in the evening, but definitely much more alive at dinner time. I also had the best insalata di mare there!! Would definitely come back.

Paganico Sabino, Lago del Turano (1 night)

on the way here, we also stopped at Santo Stefano di Sessanio, it was pretty but very empty. It's quite underwhelming imo. We also stopped for arrosticini in L'Aquila and it was very tasty! 
Soo, the village paganico sabino was a very small one, but we had a blast! Our host was really nice, we walked to a belvedere to look at the forest and the lake, it was breathtaking. The grandmas would greet us and talked to us even after we said no italiano :D there was a small restaurant, and it was like a private dining experience! we really enjoyed this small italian village. and its only one hour from Rome!

Rome (1 night)

Back to Rome, taking it all in for the last day. It was all in all just really nice. We also had a spa and massage at a place called Fancy. It was amazing and so relaxing, was a nice end to our trip.

Ask me anything! :)

ItalyTravel,"I got back from travelling around Venice last week and probably caught a light strain of Norovirus which is currently circulating in the Veneto especially around Lake Garda. 

Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis.

 Here are some common symptoms to look for if you suspect you have caught Norovirus:

Sudden Onset of Symptoms: Symptoms typically start suddenly within 12 to 48 hours after exposure.

Nausea and Vomiting: 
A hallmark symptom, often severe and frequent.Diarrhea: Watery, non-bloody diarrhea is common.

Stomach Cramps: Abdominal pain and cramping often accompany the nausea and vomiting.

Low-grade Fever: Some people might experience a mild fever.

Muscle Pain: General body aches and muscle pain can occur.

Fatigue: Feeling very tired and weak is common.

Dehydration: Due to the loss of fluids from vomiting and diarrhea, symptoms like dry mouth, decreased urination, dizziness, and feeling lightheaded can occur.

Norovirus is often spread through contaminated food, water, surfaces, or direct contact with an infected person. So don't drink tap water.

If you suspect you have Norovirus:

Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.

Practice Good Hygiene: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.

Disinfect Surfaces: Clean and disinfect surfaces that may be contaminated.

Avoid Contact with Others: Stay away from work, school, or other public places to prevent spreading the virus.

If symptoms are severe or you experience signs of severe dehydration (such as decreased urination, extreme thirst, dizziness, or confusion), seek medical attention promptly.",t2_6fawx,Norovirus in Veneto,0.71,23,1719767611.0,1719767611.0,63,Dolcevia,1ds6d0x

ItalyTravel,"Setup:

* 4 days in Rome, 2 days on the beach, 2 days in Florence + 2 days travel
* late May
* Trip with parents (two people in late twenties, two people around 60yo)
* no strong interest in arts
* I had to translate everything for my parents (therefore I have avoided guided tours where possible to have more time). They do not speak English and none of us speaks Italian.

Day 1: Took airport taxi (not pre-booked) from Ciampino airport to city center for a fixed rate 31€.

Dar 2: Walk Pasquino-Piazza Navona-Pantheon-Fontana di Trevi-Spanish steps. Followed the path from [“Heart of Rome walk” by Rick Steves](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/italy). After visiting the church on top of the Spanish steps, we went into Villa Borghese park. We rented a 4 person e-bike “car” for 20€ which fit all 4 of us. This was a lot of fun, it protected us from the light rain, and otherwise my parents would not be able to walk the park anymore.

Day 3: Vatican. We arrived at 8:45 at the St. Peter’s square. We have waited for 45 minutes for the Security control. We had booked a Vatican museum tour at 12:30. We have hoped to manage to visit the St. Peter’s Basilica (free) with the Dome (8-10€) beforehand, but **we made a mistake of not going for the Dome first**. We ended up skipping the Dome as the line took too long and we did not want to miss the Vatican tour as it was significantly more expensive and more difficult to get. It was possible to queue for the tour from 12:00. We were only able to book the guided tour which took around 2.5 hours. The tour ended before the Sistine chapel, which let you explore the chapel on your own. The tour was not terrible, nor great. Headphones had a lot of noise and it was difficult to understand. The museums were full of people, which made things worse. After visiting the Sistine chapel, we went home.

Day 4: Easier day - Wednesday. Went for the Angel’s castle in the morning which is only a short, non-guided tour. Audio guides were not available, but they have pretty good boards with some information. The mistake was to leave the castle around noon, when the audience with the pope on the St. Peter’s square has ended as people have flooded nearby streets. In the late afternoon (16:45) we tried to see if we could get to the Dome, as we did not make it on Tuesday.The security check took only \~30 minutes this time, but we were really lucky, as we queued for tickets just slightly before they had closed the gate. The gate was closed at 17:15, where the official opening time of the Dome is till 18:00.

Day 5: Went to the Colosseum in the morning for 8:50. We have booked the Full experience - Attic tickets. First, we were sent to the attic, and then we could proceed with a normal tour. The attic was amazing, mainly because it was empty. It offered an amazing viewpoint and there was almost no one. History-wise it did not offer much on top of the normal tour, but this felt like a VIP place. For booking the tickets, we have specifically waited 30 days before the date around 8:50 for the tickets to become available. Afterwards we went to Palatine Hill. This got worse and worse. The place is huge, there are no refreshments spots, not enough benches in the shades, no cafeterias, no vending machines. This is connected to the Roma Forum (and Imperial Fora). Note that we did a **mistake by leaving the premises for lunch and we were not allowed to enter again** despite the ticket clearly saying it was valid for “2 days”. These three things - Palatine Hill, Roma Forum, Imperial Forum are all connected and you can enter it only once. Therefore, we could not get to the Imperial Forum at all, as we left to cross the street and enter and they have told us there is a passage inside the Roma Forum to get to the Imperial forum. Just an overall terrible experience, since it takes hours to explore the whole area and yet one cannot split it to avoid midday sun.

Day 6: We took a morning train to Florence. We ate lunch in Florence and then walked the “Renaissance Walk” by Rick Steves and went to see David in Accademia for tickets at 14:30. Afterwards we picked up our luggage and headed for the Sixt car rental at the airport. We have noticed that the rental price was significantly cheaper at their airport location compared to the train station. Afterwards we headed by car to Viareggio.

Day 7: Morning walk on the beach, swimming in the sea in the late afternoon.

Day 8: Left for Pisa in the morning. Despite the fact that there were not enough tickets for us for the tower climb on the web, in person there were multiple times with 5+ tickets still available for an hour later. There was no queue for the tickets (how refreshing compared to Rome). Since it was Sunday morning, one could only access a portion of the cathedral, but it fully reopened after 13:30. Due to restoration works, the baptistery was closed. We took the “complete” package (10€ without climb, 27€ with climb)   and visited everything around the tower, but nothing more. We returned to Viareggio in the afternoon and went for a short swim.

Day 9: Left in the morning and returned to Florence before noon. Since we walked a big portion of the historic center before, we just grabbed lunch and stopped by the Leather school. It was nice to see locals making products, unfortunately, we did not find what we were looking for. I considered the prices really good given the locally made products (belt with turnable buckle for 45€, men’s purse for 85€ and free monogram above 50€). In the evening we left for the train to Rome. 

Day 10: Left for the airport.

Couple of notes:

* We have booked all our tickets through official vendors in advance. We have never had to wait in a line for tickets (only for the security control). It was though challenging sometimes to work with the official websites which are oftentimes non-intuitive. I recommend finding the attraction on Google Maps and there is usually a first entry referencing the official ticket seller.
* In most restaurants we were charged Coperto (“service fee”) ranging from 1 - 2.5€ per person.
* We did not experience any issues with scammers, thieves etc. 
* We got extremely lucky by arriving so late and still managed to get to the Dome.
* If I would go again, I would probably take the train from Rome to Pisa and rent a car there. Florence is really nice, but staying there only “on the way” in the midday sun twice was not good
* Food for 4 of us cost us anything between 70 - 115 € and (no appetizers, no desserts mostly, usually just water as drink and one beer)
* We have always asked for a big bottle of sparkling water, which is usually 1l and costs 3-4€.
* I can highly recommend [Rick Steve](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/italy)’s free recordings. In the end, it was sufficient for us and we did not need to buy audio guides.
* From Rome to Florence we took Italo high-speed train, which cost us 25€ per person if booked a month in advance. On the day of departure the price was 50€ per person.
* We stayed a 15 minute walk from the Vatican and beach front near Viareggio, and overall the accommodation cost us almost 2k (AirBnBs and hotel).
* We (but not my parents :)) did ""one bag"" - for him Farpoint 40, for her Decathlon Quechua Rolltop 23. Both are great backpacks. We brought extra 10l Decathlon backpack for the day and running belt for my phone, since my pants/skirts do not have secure pockets.

ItalyTravel,"Neapolitan. Al taglio. Alla pala. Tonda. Pinsa. We had to try them all. 

  
My wife and I traveled to Italy in the fall of 2023 with the goal of eating as much pizza as possible. We wanted to try the pizzas that have gained international attention and sample styles of pizza that we didn't know existed before planning this trip. 

  
First, our pizza preferences:  
We prefer modern NY style pizza. Thin. A crisp undercarriage with an air of lightness. A crust with the flavor of good bread. The toppings should be balanced both in weight and contrast: Salty, acidic, creamy, bright.    
A few of our favorite pizzas in the United States include: Fini: shallot/long hot. Razza: summer sweet corn w/ fermented peppers. Pizzeria Bianco: “Rosa”. Stretch Pizza:  Ramps three ways. Danny Boy’s Famous Original: Pepperoni.  Pizzeria Beddia: Plain pizza with Old Gold. Una Pizza Napoletana: Cosacca. 

  
Second, I love to make pizza:  
I bake pizza weekly at home. I have experimented with 72 hour cold ferments, 48 hour low yeast ferments, and sourdough ferments.  In the winter I use an electric oven with baking steel. In the summer I rotate between my OG Blackstone, Roccbox, and Ooni Koda 16.

  
Italian Pizza Adventure

  
Day 1 - Arrive in Rome. Train, tram, and foot travel to Trastevere. 

  
Dar Poeta (Trastevere, Rome) - Coppa pizza - Their pizza is neither neapolitan nor Roman style, but a blend that is unique to Dar Poeta. A popular American food writer likens the crust to sandpaper, yet I found this pizza to be delicious. Crisp, light, and a very tasty first bite on a cool fall evening in an alleyway in Trastevere. Perhaps hunger is the best sauce, and after a long flight and a nerve-wracking tram ride, the pizza at Dar Poeta was a great start to a busy week of pizza eating. 

  
L’Elementare (Trastevere, Rome) - Roman style Margherita Pizza. Nice balance of cheese to sauce. Flavorful. Wait staff was very helpful. 

  
Pizzeria La Bocaccia (Trastevere, Rome) - Pizza Al Taglio - I tried the ham and cheese and marinara. Both were very good. Light and crisp. Seemed like a local spot. The woman working the counter was no-nonsense and efficient. 

Day 2 - Breakfast in Rome exploring on foot. Train to Naples for lunch. 

  
Antico Forno Roscioli (Campo Di Fiori, Rome) - Pizza Bianca - Simplicity well executed is divine. Olive oil and salt on a thinner than focaccia-esque square. Pizza Alla Pala. This is delicious. Get there for breakfast. We were there around 8am on a Monday morning and were the only people in the place. We tried to snag a second taste on our last day in Italy on a Sunday afternoon, and the line snaked down the alleyway. 

  
Forno Campo Di Fiori (Campo Di Fiori, Rome) - Pizza Rossa, Mortadella sandwich -  Again, get there early. Both of these were amazing. A complete breakfast. You do not need anything else. Forget the Maritozzi, or Bomba, or Cornetto. All you need to start your day in Rome is a Pizza Bianca, a Pizza rossa, and a Mortadella Sandwich.

  
Pinsere (Near Termini, Rome) - Pinsa with ham, pistachios, ricotta. I ordered what they were serving for “breakfast” as we got there shortly after their 10am opening. Pinsa is a style of pizza with rules and guidelines regarding the flour blend.  It is light, airy, and “digestible”. Made from wheat, soy, rice, and sometimes spelt flours and sourdough culture. I would stop by Pinsere again if in the neighborhood. 

  
Lunch - Metro and foot travel in Naples

  
Antica Pizzeria Port Alba - (Naples) Portafoglia - We got the “wallet” pizza at what may be the world's oldest pizzeria. We enjoyed the snack on the street as school kids ordered lunch-time take away suppli and pizza.   
Antica Pizzeria Di Mateo - (Naples) Portafoglia - Had a second street pizza experience. This was not quite as good at the pizza at Port Alba. Should have joined the line for the dine-in experience. 

  
Antica Pizzeria De’ Figliole - (Naples) Pizza Fritta - This was my first taste of the balloon shaped pizza fritta or fried pizza. Pizza fritta is the pizza of the people. It has been around for a long time and has many different iterations. Flatter montanara style, or cone shaped. This was more like a fried balloon of dough with melted cheese and meat inside.  We didn’t care for this pizza. The filling was lost in the fried dough. The exterior was slightly oily. We got it for take-away and realized immediately that this beast required a knife, fork, and proper plate. (the pizza fritta at Pepe in Grani is a completely different animal). 

Stuffed, we made our way to the bus station, rode the bus to the Napoli airport, picked up a rental car, and drove South towards the Amalfi Coast.  We arrived at our accommodation, checked-in, and ran down the street to the nearest grocery store (unique name of Mr. O Pagliette) arriving as they were closing the door. They laughed and waved us in. I made a delicious meal of pasta, vegetables, cured meats, and buffalo mozzarella which was eaten under the setting sun from a terrace overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea.  
  
Day 3 - Hiked to Positano then drove Caserta  
We hiked the Path of the Gods to Positano and back. The hike is nice. Sunshine. Ocean views. Lots of stairs down to Positano and lots of stairs back up. Positano is ok. If you like people, shops, and luxury items. We went to the beach for about 10 minutes as throngs of tourists disembarked the ferry. Time to hike back! Upon returning to our car in Bomerano after completing the 11-ish mile hike, we were very hungry. The internet claimed Salumeria Manna, which was a short walk north from the parking lot, served sandwiches. We got there just moments before the proprietor closed for lunch. She cut a few slices from a crusty loaf of bread, stuffed it with provolone and cured meats, and locked up the door behind us. We sat on the curb and devoured our sandwiches, leaving a trail of crumbs in our wake.  Satisfied, we got in the car and drove north to Caserta.

  
Dinner  
I Masanielli di Francesco Martiucci - (Caserta) 8 course pizza tasting. Ranked #1 in the world in 2022 (Tied with Una Pizza Napoletana in NYC which serves an amazing cosacca pizza). We ordered the tasting menu months in advance and arrived at 7pm to a line of about 20-30 people waiting for the doors to open. Francesco Martiucci is a master of the craft. He invented a “triple-cooked” pizza which is first steamed, then fried, and finally baked in a wood fired oven. The crust on the triple cooked pizza is a perfect balance of crisp to creamy-crumb deliciousness. And the toppings on the tasting menu were as creative. Onions three ways. Dried tomatoes, tomato cream, fresh tomatoes. Beef and lemon. Tuna and pepper puree. Neapolitan pizza with an abundance of black truffles. Don’t be put off by the strip mall-esque location. Or the fact that I Masanielli was never featured on Netflix. We had an amazing evening.  I Masanielli is worth a special trip.   
Side note - our booking in Caserta was a steal. Private pool. Walled in yard. Attentive host. Affordable price.

  
Day 4 - Caserta and on to Caiazzo

  
Lunch  
I Masanielli Sasa Martiucci - (Caserta) Friggitella. Apparently the Masanielli’s have Caserta’s pizza scene on lock-down. Sasa is Francesco’s brother. This pizza lacked the deftness that was on display the evening before.  It was a good pizza to be sure, but a little bit on the heavy side. The Tiramibou for dessert was a playful and delicious take on Tiramisu. Highly recommend. 

  
On the way to Caiazzo we detoured to Casertavecchia, a former medieval village that is worth exploring.   
   
Dinner  
   
Pepe in Grani- (Caiazzo) 8 course tasting menu. Plenty of superlatives have been written about Franco Pepe and his pizza mecca located in the sleepy hillside town of Caiazzo. We went all-in and enjoyed every last bite of the full tasting menu (actually my wife hit the proverbial wall early and I ate a significant amount of her pizza). Everything was fantastic. The tomato compote on the Scarpetta pizza was the best bite of the trip. If i ever return, I would skip the tasting menu and order ala carte, with the goal of trying every different style of dough they make.   
Prior to dining we spent the afternoon wandering around Caiazzo. A town built on a hill. Narrow cobblestone passageways connecting to tiny streets. Old stone buildings. Nothing to do but explore the quiet streets on foot until dinner. Not a tourist in sight. Except for pizza fanatics. My only regret  from our stay in Caiazzo was not saving enough stomach space or time  to visit Antico Osteria Pizzeria Pepe, the Pizzeria of Franco Pepe’s family.   
Highly recommend B&B Casa Aulivo. An 18th century olive mill converted into a B&B.  Same views of the valley as you get from the terrace at Pepe in Grani but with the views all to yourself. 

  
Day 5 - Drove back to Naples, returned the rental car, and spent the afternoon walking around Naples eating pizza. 

  
Sfogliato Attanasio-(Naples)  Sfogliatella. A thin, multi-layered, crisp-flaky pastry stuffed with a perfectly balanced orange zested ricotta filling. It was the best non-pizza bite of the week. This. Slaps. 

    L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele - (Naples) -  Cosacca.  We arrived early, grabbed a ticket, and were seated in the second round after a 20 minute wait. A super touristy spot that lived up to the hype. This pizza is very good.   
      
    50 Kalo (Naples) - Cosacca. Very good. One of my favorite Neapolitan pizzas  
    Pizzeria Da Atillio (Naples) Pizza Pomod’oro- too much cheese. Pizza ended up soupy.   

Day 6 - Train to Salerno. Ferry to Amalfi. We walked from Amalfi, over to Atrani, up to Ravello, and down to Minori.  Narrow cobbled alleyways. Stone churches. Long ascending and descending staircases. Blue sky, sparkling azure sea, and glistening pebbled beaches. Architecture that inspired Escher. A fun place to explore on foot. A better walk than the Path of the Gods. 

  
Lunch  
Midnight Sun (Minori) - marinara with anchovies. Our least favorite pizza of the trip. Cornicone was dry and overbaked. We only stopped here because it was near the ferry and the other pizza shop in Minori was closed for the week.

  
Dinner  
Pizzeria La Smorfia (Salerno) cosacca - Very good. Surprisingly good. 

    Anima e Cornicone (Salerno) cosacca - Crust was good. Unfortunately, they subbed black pepper in place of a hard grated cheese and the pepper overpowered the tomato sauce.  

Day 7 - Train back to Rome  
Casa Manco (Testaccio) - a variety of Al Taglio slices. Concord grape slice was great.   
Da Teo Testaccio- Porchetta sandwich. Obviously not pizza but worth every bite!  
Trappizino (Testaccio)- Beef cheek ragu. A pizza-like, modern street food invention.  
Mastro Donato Pizza Gourmet (Testaccio) - a variety of Al Taglio slices. All very good.

    Piccolo Buco (Trevi) Roasted cherry tomato- recommended by Katie Parla as one of the better Neapolitan pizzas in Rome. Was one of our least favorite pizza’s on the trip. Excessive doming and unbalanced topping ratio all contributed to a subpar pizza.   
    Emma (Regola)- Roman style Prosciutto pizza. Also ordered a focaccia with ham and buffalo mozzarella and were surprised at their interpretation of focaccia. Apparently a focaccia at a roman style pizzeria is a roman style pizza without sauce. We also ordered our only restaurant prepared pasta dish of the trip: cacio e pepe.   
    Alice Pizza (Pantheon) Al taglio - Solid . Wouldn’t go out of my way for it, but decent al taglio.  

Day 8  
Bonci (Cipro) - Al Taglio- A perfect way to cap off a week travelling Italy eating pizza. Sunday morning Bonci’ opens with small line and tasty slices. Light. Airy. Crisp. We also snagged a ham and cheese sandwich which was nothing like an American ham and cheese sandwich. Thin, crispy, melty. Divine. 

  
8 Days. 24 Pizzerias. A few key takeaways:  
\* When it comes to neapolitan pizza we prefer the simplicity of the Cosacca.  
\* Neapolitan pizza in Naples is a amazing value. Pizza in general in Italy is a value.  
\* The average pizzeria in the Naples/Salerno area makes a more flavorful dough/crust than the average pizzeria in NYC. .   
\* Looking back, I could have eaten more pizza in Naples on Day 5 but it was a beautiful day to walk along Chiaia waterfront and take in the sunshine and views of Mt. Vesuvius.   
\* The last day of the trip was a Sunday. We tried to get to a few more spots after enjoying Bonci’s pizza but the lines were either excessively long or the places we tried to go to were closed.

ItalyTravel,"Hi! We are planning our honeymoon (yay!) and we have decided on Italy. We want to avoid the big cities and the top tourist spots, and we want to stay in a single place as to limit time spent on travel as much as possible. We speak English and plan to learn some Italian tourist phrases, but we're used to travel in places were English isn't common and aren't afraid of doing charades if needed. We plan for 10 days in September and about 300€ per day for both of us. Our day-to-day itinerary is something like:

* Spend two-three days at the beach
* Maybe look at the local art museum one day
* Visit some archaeological site nearby
* Spend one day just walking around town
* See a church
* Do a day-hike
* Do a vine tasting

So basically we want to take things slow, get to know the town and not rush between things.

Our big question now is where to go. We want somewhere with beaches and maybe hiking possibilities nearby, but that doesn't limit it much. We're looking forward to great food but that's also everywhere as I understand it. :)

Currently we are thinking Grosseto but that's basically because we threw a dart at the map and because Tuscany feels like a safe choice. We want a rustic vibe and a taste of ""real Italy"". We want to avoid places that are too posh, touristy or polished. Maybe our preferences should make us look further south?

**What is the Jubilee?**  
In the Roman Catholic tradition, a Holy Year, or Jubilee is a great religious event. It is a year of forgiveness of sins and also the punishment due to sin, it is a year of reconciliation between adversaries, of conversion and receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and consequently of solidarity, hope, justice, commitment to serve God with joy and in peace with our brothers and sisters. A Jubilee year is above all the year of Christ, who brings life and grace to humanity.

Starting in 1475, they were scheduled to occur every 25 years.

**How long is the Jubilee?**  
The Jubilee Year begins when the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica opens on Christmas Eve, 2024. The Jubilee Year ends when the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica closes on January 6, 2026, the Feast of the Epiphany.

**How crowded will Rome be during the Jubilee**  
Approximately 35 million tourists visited Rome in 2023. The city is preparing for 35 million pilgrims to descend on Rome for the Jubilee, so some estimate that Rome will be twice as crowded during the Jubilee.",t2_3bom8brd,Jubilee MEGATHREAD and FAQs,0.9,21,1730731767.0,1730731767.0,17,marshalltownusa,1gjg0tu

ItalyTravel,"Trip Report  Rome> Almafi Coast> Vico Equense (Sorrento, Capri), Naples 

**Pickpockets**: zero issues. Everyone came home with all  wallets and passports. I bought clips for my backpack pack, never used them.  We used the Rome metro frequently between Monti and the Vatican. Only one day was busy. My kids had instructions to not have phones out on the metro and when walking. 

Passports: Left them in our rooms. We had scans on our phones. Walked by dozens of  Police, they never asked for ID.  All of places that give discounts for kids accepted (and requested) scanned Passports

**Food**: Everything we ate was Great. Only one bad meal, and it was in Capri.  

**Naples**: Highly underrated. I loved it. The vibe is strong. Very fun streets to walk. Great food in Naples. The pizza is really on another level. *Don’t sleep on Naples.*

We used Naples as our fly home spot.  We used Vico Enesque (Sorrento) as our hub to go to Capri and Pompeii.  To do it over, I would stay in Naples longer and use it as hub to go to Pompeii and skip Capri and Sorrento.  Sorrento is overly touristy and very busy and everyone in our group was generally unimpressed with it. We did find Vico Enesque unique and found the restaurant Il Barrio osteria in Vico as one of the top places on our trip to eat.

While many places were crowded, for some reason Capri felt obnxious in the way that is was crowded.

My only Italy qualm, transportation was late frequently. Train from Rome to Salerno, 80+ minutes late, Ferries and busses on the Almafi Coast were always late. 

We took the bus from Amalfi to Fiordo di Furore, by late afternoon there was a very large crowd gathering to go back, the buses coming from Sorrento were packed so they weren’t picking people up leading people to hitchhike back.  Boarding buses on the coast are a free-for-all. There will be a line formed and then when the bus  doors open, people come from every direction and jam the door.  We hit the train strike on Saturday, so we had to take a taxi from Vico to Naples, a pricey ride.  Always have a back up plan on your transportation.

I recommend Google maps over apple maps in Naples and Rome. Move it app was helpful everywhere but the Almafi Coast. FreeNow app for taxis's in Rome. We did path of the Gods in Almfafi, I recommend Alltrails for this. While it generally well marked, the app comes in handy. If you remotely like hiking, this is a great hike to do with great views. The steps from Nocelle to Positano are no joke. Legs were shaking.  Airolo for esim was great, and we could call using what's app.

ItalyTravel,"A rant, our luggage got stolen out of the car as our driver went on a pee break ( I know I know maybe it was a inside job, but I don’t want to go down that path and think of working people being in on it) 

However the thing I want to say the most is after we got our bags stolen me and my wife saw to cops and tried to get them help.

And you guessed it the 2 cops didn’t give a flying f*** about our situation. The worst part was the young lady cop she just looked at us with a face of good you damn tourist deserve your stuff to be stolen. 

Anyway it is 6:35 in the morning and we had trouble sleeping because I guess stressed out and afraid our hotel room might be broken in and steal what’s left on our backs.

Only thing we are worried about is we had paper copies of our itinerary and passport for just in case. Not sure if anyone knows the possible chances of them taking our photocopy of our passports and do some malicious with it.

We will be heading to the police station today when the sun rises. 

Edit: it was on Sept 28th 6pm at the sunset hill tourist area. Also all our passports with us so that is the bright side.

Edit2: so people asking how. So when we got to the sight seeing place me and my wife got off first to walk around and take some photos. The drive went to park the car. After about 10-15 mins of walking around I was getting cold so I wanted to go back to the car to get a long sleeve shirt. 

So wife called the driving tell him where he parked. The driver respond he parked in front of the statue of David and he went for a piss. 

When we all got back to the car I was the first to notice why was the back side passenger door slightly open. (This was a 4 door passage car kind of like a hatchback car so you can see in the back of the trunk) As I open the door I look to the back of the trunk and all our luggage was gone. 

So we started to look around at that point and a by standard said they saw a couple middle eastern looking ethnic running away with said luggage as we showed them the pictures of our luggage.

We had the help of a travel agent but feel confident now that if we took another international trip, we could handle planning on our own.

ItalyTravel,"Let me start by saying this experience has not tainted our trip in Italy so far. We have been having a great time and love this country. We were leaving Venice today and two young men came up to us as we were about to board our train, and apparently stole the luggage tag off of our luggage with address, name, phone numbers, etc. written on it. They acted confused about which train they should be on and then followed us on to the train when we tried to help them understand that it was the correct train that they had a ticket for. On the short ride, they constantly stared at us and once they noticed us notice our missing luggage bag and staring back, they avoided eye contact and began acting weird. I got photos of them at this point, but will not post the pictures because I haven’t had anything stolen other than my luggage tag and I’m not sure if I should be concerned. Then, the two men switched phones randomly and continued using the others phone, which we thought was also weird. Then when we arrived at the next train station and got off (at the very first stop), they also got off and started again asking people for directions acting like they didn’t know where they were going. Instead of showing us another ticket, they instead showed us Google maps and where they were going. This leads me to believe that they did not have another ticket or were just going to return to Venice to do their scam again. Then, they started talking with another group of people that appeared to be their friends while fake asking for directions, and then disappeared into the crowd. Was this a scam? If so, what is the scam? Were they going to pick pocket us or steal our luggage? What would they do with the information on our luggage tags?

My fiance and I are planning a trip to Italy. We're staying a few nights in Rome, then going to Florence.

Doing more research, I’ve noticed Naples is quite a divisive city with some people really disliking it. I am now worried about going there. Is it really that sketchy? 
Keep in mind, me and my partner grew up and lived in Toronto our whole lives, are familiar with walking and working in “sketchy” neighbourhoods. We also have both travelled to big cities like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Tallinn, Berlin in the past. 
I’m wondering if all the “not safe” things I read is from people who have not been to a city with a bit of grunge before and if the “sketchiness” they talk about are on par with any big city. 
And if anyone has any recommendations you can let me know! :)

Update:
Thank you all for the information!! I took time to read all your comments. I am still going to go to Naples. My trip is quite soon, so it wouldn’t make sense to change the itinerary, and honestly I am looking forward to seeing it and making my own opinion.

ItalyTravel,"Flew in from Rome yesterday, landed at Toronto. My bag was on a list print out by somebody at the airport (I assume an ITA employee...?) by the baggage carousel for having been left in Rome, along with a few others' bags.

The lady had me fill out a claim form with all my info, and the same for several others. However, she had no computer with her and assured me she'd fill the data into her system before she went home, then send me the PIR (in the future I will never accept this answer; will not leave airport without a PIR). She may have done the former, but she definitely didn't send me a PIR, so **I cannot track this case.**

I have my boarding pass, bag number, I have a picture of the lady even, as she worked on the form, and her name.

The (416) number at Toronto I was given to chase down ITA never picks up. The lost baggage thing on their site requires a PIR. Since I didn't have that, I just tried their general complaint form instead.

Any other ideas?

**UPDATE 7/18**

I called customer service again for ITA Airways and after explaining my issue a couple of times (courteous, but also insistent), the guy on the line was kind enough to step away for five minutes, find somebody who could get a PIR, and actually give it to me. So this means one was created, but the original lady never told me what it was. I should be good now. I still have lessons learned here. I can find it on worldtracer although there is no update, but now if I need to claim or whatever I can do so.


**UPDATE 7/17**

This is going as expected, I'm afraid. The online generic complaint form I submitted to yesterday including pictures and a complete description. It's almost like talking to AI.

In order for us to provide you with feedback, we would kindly ask you to reply to this e-mail by attaching the following documents:

If you received the PIR code, Could please send us a copy of it.

Please note that, should this information or documentation be missing, we will not be able to proceed with the case.
Sincerely  
ITA Airways Customer Relations

Thank you for your reply.
 
Can you please re-read my original email? I do not have a PIR code because your employee at Toronto Pearson did not give me one. That doesn't mean there isn't one; I am hopeful that she did, in fact, submit the document we filled out together—but she did not inform me what the code was, so I have no idea if one exists or not.

Surely you have a way to identify if a PIR code was created and is associated with the information I provided in my submission? I sent all my info including a picture of this lady filling out the form at the baggage carousel.
 
Thank you!

Dear Mr. DontEatConcrete,

With reference to the e-mail you sent on July 17th, 2024, we reiterate our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience you experienced when traveling with ITA Airways from Rome to Toronto on flight AZ 650 on July 15th, 2024.

We fully understand how uncomfortable these situations can be for our customers, and we are truly sorry if this experience has left you with a negative impression of our airline. Please know that ITA Airways is committed to continuously work on improving our baggage handling procedures in order to minimize these occurrences.

Allow us to explain that customers should report the disservice immediately upon arrival at the Lost and Found Office and obtain a Property Irregularity Report prior to leaving the airport premises. 

If guests fail to report the damage/missing baggage upon arrival, the carrier must assume that the bag was delivered in good condition, in accordance with the air transport contract (Art. 31, paragraph 1 of the Montreal Convention).

As you did not obtain a Property Irregularity report prior to leaving the airport premises, we must respectfully deny your request for compensation.

Sincerely  
ITA Airways Customer Relations

---------------

Thank you for your prompt reply.

However, I am not [yet] seeking compensation, as I am not yet sure my bag is lost forever.

To reiterate, I absolutely did report my bag as missing before leaving the airport. I have photographic proof of having reported it, literally while it was being reported @ Carousel #13. I will reattach those pictures here. They are of ****************. She was very helpful—except for the fact she provided no PIR.​

I did not receive a PIR before leaving because this ITA Airways employee specifically told me it would not be available until later in the day. I was instructed by your employee to merely fill out the form, and then leave.

What I do not have is a PIR number. Are you able to search your system to determine if a PIR number was created for my bag?

Thank you!
DontEatConcrete

**still waiting on a response...**...*Small update on this complaint, 7/22: when I login it says ""dear customer, your case is managed"" for my original complaint--so this means once they told me to piss off because I didn't have a PIR they considered the matter settled. *

In the meantime I have called their Toronto baggage number at least half a dozen times--I got the same number from two separate Lost and Found employees, so I'm sure it's the correct one (416-776-9022). They just do not answer the phone.

I don't think the employee acted in bad faith, but her telling me to leave without a PIR has potentially screwed me over. I'm still optimistic the bag will show up.

1) I will never leave an airport without a PIR again--even though I was acting in unequivocal direction from an ITA airlines employee

2) I will never check baggage without air tags

Last person at Lost & Found was friendly but couldn't help me at all. Said I really need to get to the airport again if ITA never gets back to me. I'm there next week but that's a while to wait...I'm also not at all convinced that asking a person responsible for checking in can help me at all, since they won't be able to call baggage, either.

ItalyTravel,"tl;dr: We really enjoyed our trip more because we rented a car, and it's not as bad as people online say.

Before deciding to rent a car, I read so many posts saying it's inconvenient, expensive, challenging, etc etc to rent a car and drive in Italy, so I wanted to share our experience.

Background: 30's American couple on 14 day honeymoon through Italy.  We stayed in Rome > Siena > Florence > Venice > Modena > Milan with a bunch of stops and day trips along the way.

It's obviously not the cheaper way to travel (some costs below) but we thought the convenience and flexibility we had with time made it well worth it.  We got to see small charming towns like Calcata Vecchia and feed their street cats, see the picturesque green countryside, visit vineyards in Tuscany and Valpolicella, and make day trips through Emilia-Romagna for all the food attractions.  It also made exiting Milan to Malpensa (MXP) at 5am very convenient.  

We used Expedia which eventually linked us up to Drivalia to rent a car.  We picked up the car on our last day in Rome from a location within the city.  (Note that the airport is about an hour away, so don't bother renting from that location if you're already in town.)  They gave us an MG hybrid SUV which worked for us given our luggage situation, but I'd recommend going smaller if you can.  We did a one way rental and returned it at MXP airport near Milan. 

Costs:

- $569 for the car rental for 11 days.  Could be slightly less with a smaller car.

- ~$120 for additional insurance.

- ~$160 for gas - gas is expensive in Italy.

- ~$210 for parking between street parking and 4 garage nights.  If I put more effort into street parking, this could have been much less.

Total: About $1060.  (I converted at $1.10 USD to EUR to calculate this.) Probably 3x the price vs if we did trains and taxis, but being on our own schedule and the convenience with luggage (we DO NOT travel light) made it worth it IMO. 

Tips:

- You need an international driving permit (IDP), your state issued drivers license, and your passport to rent a car.  We got our IDP from AAA for $20 each plus passport photos in under 20 minutes with no appointment.

- ZTL (Zona Traffico Limitato) exist in every town and city we visited.  Handling it is as simple as googling the ZTL maps beforehand and avoiding it.  Some hotels located within ZTL can  pre-register your license plate so you can drive into the ZTL.  We mostly stayed in hotels on the border of the ZTL and had no issue.  I'm told the fine could be between 80-300 euros.

- Look up European traffic signs beforehand.

- White lined parking spots are free, blue lined ones are paid either by a nearby kiosk or the strongly recommended EasyPark app.  Do not park in yellow lined spaces ever.  Our hotel in Modena gave us a card to put on our dash that gave us free parking in blue spots for our stay, not sure if that's a thing in other towns as well.

- When driving in cities, you have to be a confident driver, but all the comments about Italian drivers being aggressive are so overblown.  If you're confident driving in an American city, you should handle Italian cities no problem.

- With highway driving, Italians are amazingly good at practicing 'keep right, pass left,' so you should too.  That means Pennsylvania and Massachusetts drivers are disqualified from driving in Italy.

- Biggest differences from driving in the US seemed to be that lanes are a suggestion (if there are lanes at all) and what may appear to be a one-way street is, in fact, a two-way street.

- The big gas stations like Autogrill are amazing rest stops and put American ones to shame.  Enjoyed fresh smoothies and great espresso at some.

- None of the gas pumps I used had the option to pay at the pump like American ones.  You either pump the gas then pay the attendant inside, or pre-pay at a kiosk nearby.  Not sure if it's just me, but my cards never worked at these kiosks so have cash handy.  

- Some of the best driving roads I've ever had the pleasure of driving through were in Chianti country.  I wish I had a sports car to enjoy them with!

- edit: Wanted to add that you should select automatic transmission as a filter when you book if you can't drive stick since most rentals are manual.

ItalyTravel,"Just spent four nights in Florence. 

Day 1: Arrived by train on Sat from Bologna. Couldnt check in yet, so had lunch at Risotteria Melotti. I realize this is a chain but as the only risotto ive had so far this trip, was impressed. Gelato at My Sugar, mom loved the black sesame. Free walking tour from 3:30-5:30, highly recommended to learn more about the city and get some good local recommendations (he had a google doc for us). Also wandered around Mercato Centrale, wow the 2nd floor makes a north amercian food court look like trash, which it usually is. Didnt eat anything, but so much looked good and it was packed. 

Dinner at Il Latini, be sure to make a reso. Had the 1.7kg porterhouse, potatos, and tiramisu. Stuffed. Streets were packed today, long weekend and all. 

Day 2: Morning run along the Arno and up to Piazzale Michelangelo for sunrise, love early mornings and especially here, quiet and peaceful. Given it was the first Sunday, and state museums were free, we lined up first for the Accademia. Was about a 40minute line, but worth it. Had the free Rick Steve audio guide, very good. 

Next was the Uffuzi, another big lineup, about 45min that went all the way around. Wow this place is massive. Used the rick steve audioguide again, which showcased the significant artworks, but not necessarily comprehensive. Wouldn't have appreciated it without the guide. Very busy inside as expected given it was free. Took a break at the cafe, expensive and nothing to write home about, but a little refreshment and snack on a patio was needed. 

Lined up again for lamprodetto at Trippaio del Porcellino, I eat tripe at home but this was different. 

We walked across to Palazzo Pitti. We were too late for the boboli gardens, but honestly just seeing the grandeur of the palace was enough. One of the most spectacular palaces Ive seen. 

Dinner at Osteria Cinghiale Bianco. No reso, but we we were there at 6pm and got a table. Ordered the onion flan, boar ragu, and boar with polenta and tiramisu. Food and service were great. Seems lots of the poor reviews for different cafe/restos are due to poor service, but havent encountered that at all. If anything, servers have been too quick to ask me what Id like on the menu. 

Day 3:

I didnt book the Brunelleschi Pass early enough, so only got the 6pm time slot for the dome. Pass is activated that day, so in the morning, went up the bell tower at 8:15am opening. My mom had no issues with the stairs, and we enjoyed a beautiful morning from the top. Nobody rushed us down, and probably spent 30 minutes up there. Went for a caffe, and then went inside the baptistry. You cant see the mosiacs due to restoration, and we had seen the impressive ones in Ravenna already. Both the free entrance and the crypt entrance had a big looking lineup, but it was only about 20minutes to get in. The crypt was fascinating, while the interior of the Duomo was barren as expected. But still interestimg to look up at the dome, my main interest. 

Next was the Galileo/science museum. Really interesting collection of scientific instruments, as somebody with an engineering background, this was fascinating. Definitely download the app beforehand to get more info about the displays. For a non-science person with limited time, you could probably skip this. 

Went for a quick walk through the Duomo Museum after. Would have saved this for next day, Tuesday, but its closed on the first Tues. great view of the dome from the terrace on the 3rd floor. 

Lined up at 5:30pm for our 6pm dome climb so we would be in front. Mom and i loved the dome climb, the claustrophobic stairs were a treat. i didnt think it was redundant to go up both the dome and tower, but if i were to redo it, id go up the dome at sunset. 

Went for pizza at Pizzium, would have gone to Gusta, but closed on Monday. The two ""regional"" pizzas, puglia and lombardia. Great service, fast, and not too busy. 

Day 4: While Florence was beautiful, it felt busy with all the traffic and taxis on the streets. Couldn't decide between Siena or Lucca as a daytrip (no, we didnt try to go to Cinque Terre), and settled on Sienna by bus. Bought a ticket from the bus station, those paper receipts/tickets are tricky to validate, yoi have to fold them in half to insert, whereas the tickets from the self-serve machine are smaller and fit in. 

Easy walk from bus stop to Piazza Campo. Favourite Piazza so far. paid 10euro for the ticket to climb up Torre Mangia. Not busy at all, bought my ticket, waited for 10:45am. You only get about 15minutes up there, but it was a spectacular view. Love these medieval towers and super narrow staircases. 

Had coffee at Torrefazione Fiorella and delicious panini at Bocconcino, my favourite so far, and convenient to eat nearby. 

Paid 5euro for the duomo entrance only. Used the Rick Steve guide again, wow, spectacular inside and outside. We walked around some more,  just checking out the little streets and views before the 4:45pm bus back to Florence. I'll need to spend some more time in these tuscan towns next time. 

Hop off the bus and had dinner The Antico Ristoro di Cambi. florentine steak, potatos, onion were great. Personally, I prefer my steak more on the medium rare side, but was enjoyable to try it here anyways. 

Day 5:

Went for a run along the river, and then packed up bags. Grabbed a sandwich at Antico Vinaio for the train ride to Roma. Might be touristy, but there was no lineup, convenient and delicious on the train. 

Next and final spot, Roma! Already have the Vatican and Colosseum booked, four full days to explore, welcoming recommendations! Grazie!",t2_b6st1np6,Florence trip report - Nov 2-6,1.0,22,1730894370.0,1730894370.0,7,Obvious-Surround5026,1gkwu66
ItalyTravel,"This feels like such a dumb question, but I can’t get it out of my head. 

Context: I know very little Italian. I can say hello, goodbye, ask if someone speaks English, explain that I don’t speak a lot of Italian, and order some meals. 

Question: Is it weird to start with “buongiorno” and then go into English if I need to? And then sprinkle in a “grazie” when appropriate? Will I look like a try-hard? 

I want to genuinely put forth an effort to speak Italian because I want to respect the people who live here, but I just don’t know that much!

Edit: Thank you, all! I just arrived in Florence yesterday and the lack of sleep was making me even more anxious about this. Just ordered coffee and it was lovely!

ItalyTravel,"Ciao, everyone. I thought I would share an overview of our family’s trip along with some tips. As background there was 4 of us on this trip, my spouse and I, our 3 year old son and my mother in-law. My wife and I went to Italy last year (Milan, Florence, Rome) for 10 days, this trip was about 10 days as well. Our son and my mother in-law had never been to Italy.

Our flight was through Iceland air via Reykjavik (even though the airport is technically in Keflavík…) and the flights were in to and out of Rome. We decided to rent our car in Rome and drop it off later on in the trip in Verona, and take trains to get back to Rome. 

Montemerano:

We drove from Rome after our flight in and stayed in the small village of Montemerano for the night so we could go to the Terme di Saturnia hot springs in the morning. The town was incredibly cute, very cheap to stay in, and had a handful of restaurants to choose from.

The hot springs were incredible (and free), just like the pictures. They have paid parking, a small restaurant/ cafe with a ton of food and drink options, bathrooms with showers, and lockers to store your stuff. After the hot springs we drove to San Gimignano for our stay there.


San Gimignano:

My spouse and I wanted to stay here when we visited briefly from our last trip so we splurged and stayed in one of the towers. 

Staying in one of the towers was…fine. It was cool for the moment, but other than  the location being great,the novelty does wear off. Parking within the city is a no go, even if you are staying within the walls, so expect some walking back to your vehicle to the outside of the city.


We kind of just stayed in town and ate, drank and shopped for the two days while we were there. We did the large tower climb along with the church which was nice to see. The restaurant that stuck out to us the most was Le Vecchie Mura. The food was great and the view was perfect. If you don’t have a reservation, you better show up when they open at 6.


Sirmione (Lake Garda)

Another place my spouse and I wanted to stay in after visiting there briefly before was Sirmione. We did stay in the old town near the center, but parking within the old town here was also not happening. The key with parking in Sirmione is ensuring you have driven  as far down enough where you don’t have to walk as far to the old town. The town is  beautiful and very easy to take the ferry in and out but very touristy, even at night, so something to keep in mind.

If you are visiting Lake Garda with or without a car, I would still recommend staying in Desenzano or Peschiera. They both have a train station, and you can easily take ferries to the other lake towns or drive if you have a car. Taking the ferries around Lake Garda is cool, but a car is more efficient (in my opinion) if you’re trying to cover more towns.

Our visit to Lake Garda was mainly for a trip to Gardaland for our 3 year old son, and the wine festival that the town of Bardolino puts on each year. In short, Gardaland is great for kids and parents alike. The vibe feels almost like a family owed Carowinds or Six Flags. There is also an aquarium as well which we didn’t see. The wine festival is great as well, it has a very local vide with lots of wine and food stalls. The restaurant that stood out to us the most was L’Arcimboldo in Sirmione. Great view of the lake and had amazing food at a pretty good price.

After our stay in Sirmione we dropped our car off at Verona airport that morning, took a taxi to Verona train station, and took our train to Florence.

Florence:

We only stayed a couple days in Florence but wanted to stay in the Santo Spirito neighborhood this time, which was well worth it. The neighborhood seemed a lot less hustle and bustle and fit our style well. Pricing was a little better as well, for example a spritz in Santo Spirito was between €4.5-€6 there and about €6-€10 elsewhere in the city.

Restaurant wise we loved Gustapizza and La Grotta Guelfa. I loved Gustapizza because they had a separate to-go order line form people who where waiting to dine. Guelfa had a pretty extensive menu and we enjoyed the people watching.

We saw Pitti Palace and the Duomo. Technically I only saw the line to the Duomo, because my son had to use the potty right when we got to the front of the line (go figure).

Rome:

This time in Rome we stayed closer to the Vatican, very close to the San Pietro station. That station was very easy in and out and almost never crowded. Last time my wife and stayed in Rome (which was by ourselves) we stayed in Trastevere. Trastevere is great and definitely worth staying in, but we didn’t feel it was super 3 year old friendly. 

Our stay was short here so we saw the colosseum, the Vatican and we did a lot of church hopping. FYI Rome is covered in scaffolding for the jubilee next year so be prepared.

The restaurants we liked in Rome were Ristorante Dai Miei, Ristorante Pizzeria La Vittoria. 

Miscellaneous tips:

Even if it’s only the literal day before, you should definitely book your train tickets ahead of time. It’s not worth the headache to get to the train station without tickets and realize the next train to where you want to go is X amount of hours later, because the earlier time tickets are all sold out.

Depending on your rental car company you may need an international driver’s permit to rent a car (you get them from AAA if you’re from the states).

When you are getting on the highway in Italy, you will be given a ticket that should have the name of the nearest town or something on it (some also include the date and time). Before you go through the gate/ arm, ensure your ticket is not blank. If it is, push the button for another one. The machine when you get off the highway to pay will not take a blank ticket, and you’ll have to deal with someone over the intercom in the booth.

Prebook tickets for major sites weeks to months in advance, or try with a tour group if it’s last minute.

If you’re trying to go to a museum for free, a lot of them are free the first Sunday of the month between Oct-March, but prepare to stand in an unbelievably long line.

Odd tip and maybe obvious but, if it’s raining/ will rain, the lines to museums, churches etc. that usually have long lines, appear to be significantly shorter.

We had no pickpocket or stolen bag issues. We kept a small cross body bag with the stuff we didn’t want to loose on our front and literally put our hands on it when we went into crowds. No issues.

Even though we brought our 3 year old we did not bring a car seat or a stroller. The car seat that came with the rental car was just as great as ours back home. We didn’t need a stroller because we bought a soft harness we could strap him in like a backpack. He was ether in the backpack or walked. My wife and I took turns carrying him, worked out fine.

Don’t put too much stock in google reviews alone. Try and ask your host or hotel for recommendations and then cross reference with google. I also used the Fork app and trip advisor.

The train apps along with Omio were helpful with travel. Fork is also a great food reservation app and great to look at reviews.

When we didn’t have our car, taxis for us (a family of 4) were worth the cost and time savings vs trying to take a bus or local train to get to where we were staying, with all our bags and such.

If you’re sketched out with taking money out of an ATM, find an actual bank or the post office to take out money. The fees will be better too. I was amazed that all the post offices we ran into had ATMs.

As far as the Italian language: Yes, no, please,thank you would will really be all you need. If you want to step it up from there, learning: “could I have” “may I have” or “can I have” and just point at what you want, also goes a long way. 

The Italians are kind and helpful, but if you’re used to the customer service vibe like in the United States you may feel that they sometimes come off a little rude. They’re not rude, they are just trying to do their job. Don’t let it be a turn-off.

The Italians smoke like chimneys, in comparison to people in the USA. Don’t let the frequency of smoking surprise you.

As many others we unfortuantly got fined when leaving the bus. 172 euros.

We were a party of 4 and all tapped our own individual credit cards, we tap until we see the green ok.
We have been traveling all week with the credit cards tap, no problem, had one ticket check prior with no issues.

Leaving the bus we were approached by two ticket controllers.

They could not see in their system, that either of us 4 should have tapped our cards.
They could clearly see our previous trips the same day, but not the current.

All other people leaving the bus was checked and no issues with them only us.

I called my italian friend and he discussed the things with the controllers over the phone.

The controllers was very friendly and not at all sketchy. They took a lot of time to explain us what was going on and etc.

My italian friend recommended us to pay the fine on the spot and contest afterwards.

The two ticket controllers advised us to find bank statements stating that we indeed payed, however our bank statements only shows a pooled daily transaction from the bus company and not each individual bus rides.
Our concern is that since it doesnt appear that we scanned on the bus, we won't get withdrawn on our bank accounts, thus having no proof of the fare.

The two ticket controlleres also informed us that when reviewing our contest they will look at security footage, to see if we indeed did tap our cards. Anyone with experience of this?

We will call our bank / Visa / Mastercard and ask if they can provide proof of the individual bus fares / the tap on the bus.

Do Italians have a lifetime supply of speeding tickets ? 
Do these speed cameras not work and they know? 
Do they even pay these tickets if they get them?

ItalyTravel,"Just noting some things. A couple of plugs for tour companies (only plugging them because we loved the tours. I get nothing for recommending them). Also, used the fork app for restaurant reservations-worked great. And used free time for taxis. Trenitalia for trains.

 Rome -  5 nights:

Walked most places. Didn’t use the bus.

Vatican Museum was so packed with tour groups you couldn’t get close to the more famous exhibits. Was sorry I went. Glad I saw it last time I was in Rome.

The line to get into St Peter’s basilica was so long it would have taken 2-3 hours. Glad I saw it when I was last in Rome. It is a beautiful place worth seeing. When there last I took a tour of the underground/St Peter’s burial site. Not sure if that tour is still available.

Got scammed by a taxi driver to take us back to Trastevere but we were so tired from being packed like a herd of cattle in the museum we didn’t care.

Did Pantheon audio tour. Worth it.

Had booked a tour of Pompeii with a “wine train”. Unfortunately the train was hours late so the tour company had to cancel. Got a refund as the tours were full for the days we would be in Rome. Will be an excuse to return to Italy.

Loved the other museums, Apian Way and Catacombs. Hired a private tour guide, Marta  who was amazing.  www.guidedtourofrome.com om

Florence - 6 nights

The city is much smaller than Rome - easy to walk to most places.

The Uffizi is open on Tuesday evenings - go then.  Crowds were tolerable. 

Had a private tour of Michelangelo-related historical sites. Alessia was amazing. Visited many smaller museums and ended at the Academy museum. I found it worth the $$. www.guidedtoursofflorence.com

Took a tour of three wineries. Loved it. Very small group, great guide and amazing wineries. Tuscany Tour Time.

Didn’t bother with Duomo. It was packed. Did that years back and since I’m claustrophobic I had a panic attack climbing to the top.

Took train to Siena for a day trip. Worth it.

If you are staying in the city center be aware that it is noisy late night.

Pickpockets unzipped my husband’s backpack but he only had a hat and water in it. Just be aware and keep things zipped up.

Took train from Florence to Riomaggiore. Saw a dog poo in the middle of the train station. Poor thing obviously had an issue. Owners didn’t clean it up. I’m sure some poor person stepped in it and probably drug their luggage through it. Watch where you step.

The trains don’t always run on time. Don’t recommend real tight connections. I recommend using Trenitalia app over Trainline. If you need to make changes you’ll most likely have to do them through Trenitalia anyway. Has the best information on train status and arriving/departing platforms.

Cinque Terra (Riomaggiore) - 3 nights

Beautiful and relaxing. Didn’t hike (except just walking around is a hike) but saw many doing so. Wanted some down time and can’t think of a better place to just relax. Not for mobility impaired. Too many hills/steps.

Assisi - 2 nights

Wish I had booked another day here. So much to see. Good restaurants, shopping, a couple of shops with amazing pastries. I didn’t feel bad about eating one since we did so much walking and hill climbing.

If you love beautiful Basilicas and churches this is a must visit town. They are simply amazing.

Went to a museum commemorating how the Catholics assisted Jews during  WWII. Worth watching the movie provided in the museum.

Took train back to Rome.

Rome - 1 more night. Stayed at the Hilton Garden by the airport for flight the next morning. Free shuttle to airport. The hotel was crawling with people. Very clean hotel.

Will be back in a couple of years but will visit smaller towns and Pompeii since I missed it on the trip.

So, is it possible to visit both the underground, arena, and attic all with entry times within 25 minutes of each other, does the entry time really matter? 

Is there one I should do over the other, and am I able to sell one of them? 

I saw I can change the names I entered for the attic tickets, but I did not see that ability with the underground + arena tickets. 

At first there was nothing for both, but I realized the attic ticket entry times were every 20 minutes and my timing was off for the 4am release. So 4:10 came around and I refreshed and there they were, tickets for 10:10am.

I grabbed the attic tickets immediately and checked out. When I was finished I closed out and the underground + arena tab I had open refreshed and suddenly there were 2 tickets for 9:45 there too and in my 4am brain fog and excitement I bought those too.

And for anyone trying on the new colosseo.it site, not sure if it helped much but I recommend creating a user account before trying to get tickets and make sure you’re logged in. 

Tickets for the attic seemed to go on sale 30 days in advance at the exact time (i.e. 5/13 10:10am tickets went on sale on 4/13 at 10:10am), but the underground+arena tickets did not seem to be the same, at least with how it was displayed on the site.

ItalyTravel,"We traveled to Florence by renting a car. We picked up the car near the Vatican, which was slightly scary until we got to the highway. The drive was nice, our airbnb has a parking spot where we parked and unloaded. We returned the vehicle that same afternoon easily, avoiding ZTLs. 

On the 2nd day, we visited the Accademia Gallery for 9am (made it there around 10 because I slept in). If you purchased tickets from the actual website, you have to go to the ticket booth first to get the tickets. 

We had brunch at Shake Cafe, which was very good, would recommend (but not the muffins, they're very dry). 

We then went to the Uffizi and spent about 1.5 hours there. The rest of the afternoon we walked around Florence and finished our evening at the Ferris Wheel. It was quite lovely, and there was basically no one there, I think we were the only ones on it until we got off. 

Day 3 we had a tour of Siena, San Gimignano, and Pisa. It was a long day, but worth it! We had lunch at a winery, which was beautiful and I adored San Gimignano, if you can, go!

Side note for the Pisa tower, you cannot bring any bags up it with you, including purses, so pack accordingly. We had some time after coming down to relax on a patio with a glass of wine.  I would also recommend checking out the cemetery.  

Day 4, we headed to Bologna in the morning,  walked around the entire city aimlessly,  doing some shopping,  then sat for lunch and wine for a  bit until heading back to the train station,  but not before stopping in Bottega Sacro Cuore, for another glass of wine. I also recommend it. 

We got back to Florence with just enough time to walk to the Duomo and climb the 463 stairs. It was not easy,  but the view from the top made it worth it.  Note here,  if you're claustrophobic,  the stairwells can be quite steep,  and if you have mobility problems,  there are areas where the stairs are more like a ladder.

I researched A LOT before going and while planning, and this subreddit was immensely helpful. So, I figured I would return the favor in case anyone would enjoy reading this or find it helpful in planning their own trips! 

Quite long, but hopefully you don’t mind reading it!

We stayed in very nice hotels, which definitely colors our experience a bit. However, this time of year, these hotels were often 2-3x less than high season, if that helps anyone.

**Places Visited**: Positano/Capri, Florence, Surrounding Tuscany/Hill Towns, Rome

**Highlights**: Boat tour to/around Capri, Pompeii Tour, Path of Gods Hike, All of Florence, Tuscan E-Bike Tour, Montalcino Wineries Tour, Wandering around Rome

**General Pointers/Notes**:

\- Spent several days each in Florence and Rome and did not encounter any significant issues with pickpockets at all. Granted, we relied primarily on taxis rather than public transport, but even at Florence train station (Santa Maria Novella), it was a non-issue. Definitely keep your wits about you, and we kept everything in small hip bags that I could keep under my arm rather than our pockets. But, I felt this was overblown (personally), though I recognize my experience may not be universal.

\-  We got VERY lucky with weather. We were excited to visit the Amalfi Coast (we have always wanted to), and were hopeful that crowds would be less at the end of October/early November, but we packed and were prepared for rain. It did not rain one drop the entire two weeks, and it was sunny and high 70s on the coast. We could still do boat trips and swim, which was incredible. The evenings in the cities and in Tuscany were a bit chillier, but nothing that pants and a light jacket/sweater couldn’t handle. We heard it rained A LOT in early October this year, so we definitely just got lucky (maybe honeymoon magic), but the point is, don’t alter plans just because it might rain! Even if it did, I have no doubt our trip would have still been wonderful.

\-  That being said, after daylight savings time, it did mean the sun was fully set by 530pm. This was not that big of a deal, but it did cut into the amount of daylight for certain activities. We were usually done with planned stuff by then, had an aperitivo around sunset, walked around/explored the cities, and went to dinner around 730-8pm

\-  Food was incredible, and you cannot really go wrong with just choosing a place you walk by. However, around major attractions, if there are folks begging you to come in or if they have pictures or real food displayed outside, its probably a tourist trap. And reservations might help for the most popular places (i.e. La Giostra in Florence), but otherwise this time of year was not too busy.

\- Rented a car for driving around Tuscany, which was simple with Google Maps and perfect. Definitely some tight streets in the Tuscan towns, but nothing crazy. However, could not imagine driving almost anywhere else in Italy, particularly in the cities or especially on the Amalfi Coast. And we like to rent cars in most places we travel when possible.

\- Rome is definitely under major renovations for the Jubilee (which everyone knows about). On our last day (Sat Nov 9), they just opened the walkway over the Trevi fountain. Looks cool, but I believe you have to pay and the line for it was absolutely nuts, just to get a bit closer and get your photo in front of the fountain (which is still empty). Seems not worth it. Otherwise, sculptures in Piazza Navona and other Piazzas were largely covered, and many large buildings had scaffolding throughout. However, simply wandering the city was fantastic and we felt it really did not detract from our experience that much. The colosseum and Vatican are still fine, and there are endless things to do aside from the big monuments.

\- We did not have time to visit a variety of towns on the Amalfi Coast, but visiting several in one day like I have seen some tours offer seems like it would be exhausting.

\- San Gimignano in Tuscany was very cool, but it was not markedly different from Pienza/Montepulciano/Montalcino and way more touristy/crowded

**Day 1**: Arrived to Positano around 4pm (US -> Rome -> Naples, pricey taxi to Positano). Checked in, enjoyed sunset drinks on our hotel terrace, had dinner at Da Vicenzo (very good), called it an early night

**Day 2**: Explored Positano for the day, dinner at La Tagliata (kind of overrated in my opinion – everyone is served the same fixed menu, given a bottle of cheap and very sweet red wine, cash only)

**Day 3**: Boat Tour to/around Capri with Plaghia Charters (highlight of the trip), with plenty of time to explore island on foot. Dinner back in Positano was pizza at Sarascena d’Oro (which was honestly pretty good). 

**Day 4**: Day trip to Pompeii. Tour with Walks of Italy + walked around on our own. Dinner back in Positano at Da Gabrisa (very good)

**Day 5**: Hiked the Path of the Gods (we started in Praiano via cab from hotel, hiked up A LOT of stairs to the point where path intersects from traditional starting point in Bomerano). Absolutely incredible hike. We took about 4ish hours and finished in early afternoon down in Positano. Chilled on the beach before going to dinner at Zass at il San Pietro (unbelievably beautiful restaurant, quite pricey, but very very good).

Would have loved to go to Ravello to explore, but just ran out of time since we also wanted to make sure we just relaxed plenty as well.

**Day 6**: Cab -> Naples, train to Florence. Arrived into Florence around 1pm. Had panini from All Antico Vinaio (which was very good, but definitely over touristy. Can get equally good paninis anywhere selling them on schicciata bread in my opinion). Climbed the Duomo around sunset at 430. Explored the city and had dinner at La Giostra (which is all over social media now, but I thought it was phenomenal. One of the best meals of our trip). Grabbed a cheap bottle of wine and gelato and drank it chilling by the Arno River + exploring Florence streets.

**Day 7**: Accademia at 9 am, lunch at Mercato centrale (phenomenal), walked around city, Uffizi gallery at 2. Dinner was tour of Santo Spirito neighborhood with Eating Europe (highly recommend)

**Day 8**: Explored Pitti Palace/Boboli Gardens in the AM. Cab to airport to pick up rental car around 1 (which was very easy and avoided any issues with ZTL zones). Drove to the Santierelsa trail and explored some neat waterfalls, walked around San Gimignano and had dinner, drove to our hotel outside of Montepulciano.

**Day 9**: E-bike tour of Montepulciano/Pienza (highlight of the trip). Drove to Bagno Vignoni (very small, quaint town that is good for lunch), more time walking around Pienza and had drinks at sunset along the wall overlooking Tuscany (truly breathtaking). Dinner at 13 Gobbi in Montefollonico (very very good and cheap).

**Day 10**: Slept in, cooking class through our hotel. Tour of De’Ricci winery in Montepulciano, explored and had dinner in town.

**Day 11**: Wine tour of two wineries in Montalcino area with private driver (most pricey part of our trip, but incredible and worth it) Could certainly have driven ourselves, but did not want to risk it. Dinner at hotel

**Day 12**: Drive to Rome, returned car at airport (added fee for different return location, but was worth it and very easy). Explored Villa Borghese, Trevi, Spanish Steps, Pantheon. Dinner at Vico pizza (which was so cool and good)

**Day 13**: Colosseum/Forum/Palatine Hill tour with Walks of Italy. Lunch in Monti neighborhood and exploring. Dinner at Vanda (pretty good, but not a standout of the trip) in Trastevere + exploring neighborhood

**Day 14**: Early Vatican Tour (Pristine Sistine with Walks of Italy – excellent, though early wake up!). Shopping and exploring streets around Campo d’Fiori area. Dinner at Cucina del Teatro (highly recommend).

ItalyTravel,"Hello everyone! 

Next year I turn 29 and it was my dream since childhood to do a Europe backpacking trip in my 20's. So since I had not ever been to Europe I decided after much research and deliberation that I will finally go to Italy for 14 days in March to fulfill my dream. My rough itineary looks like this - 2 days in Rome, 2 days in Florence, 2 days in Cinque Terre, 2 days in Venice, 1 day in San Marino, 2 days in Matera, 2 days in Naples(one day sky diving in Nettuno and also pompeii if possible), 1 day in Orvieto and then next day back to Rome to catch my flight to India. 

  
Now since last few days my family and friends have started sending me messages that don't even think about going to Italy since they have declared it a Jubilee year and every place will be much more crowded and expensive while many places could be closed for renovation! 

  
Please it is a sincere request to you all to guide me, since this trip means a lot to me and I have been saving money for more than a year to make this trip happen. I have to do one backpacking trip in Europe next year anyhow to complete my dream and Italy was the perfect place because it offered rich history, amazing architecture, unique villages like matera and cinque terre, delicious food and so much more.

I am from India and it will cost an arm and a leg for me so I don't want to ruin my experience but in all honesty I can't think of any other place in Europe either because Italy offers everything I expect from a trip and especially since I made up my mind about Italy.

Does it make sense to go in March 2025 due to Jubilee, will it be too crowded to ruin all the fun, will places be much more expensive than usual throwing my budget off the hook, will booking hotel and transport be a pain?",t2_177dyl,Should I go to Italy in March of 2025,0.73,18,1722995761.0,1722995761.0,72,sidraiz,1elzte1

ItalyTravel,"Greetings! I just finished my first trip to Rome and thought I’d give a recap of the Rome Pass. 

We got the 72 hour for €52

- picking up. We got ours at the airport, super easy once we found the TI. 

- validating. Took the bus from Termini to our accommodation. Found the swipe point in the back of the bus easily. Activated right away. 

Here is our breakdown 

Roma pass €52
- Transit €0 (3 day unlimited included in pass) 
- Colosseum/Forum/Palatine €0 (1st site free)
- Castel Sant'Angelo €0 (2nd site free) 
- Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini €8 (reduced) 
- MNR museums €8 (reduced)
Total spent €68


Cash
- Transit €9 (6 rides @€1.5 each)
- Colosseum/Forum/Palatine €16
- Castel Sant'Angelo €16
- Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini €12
- MNR museums €12
Total spent €65

We had planned on going to the Capitoline Museum but I wasn’t feeling well one day so we took an extended lunch. If we had gone it would have broke even at €78 each. 

In conclusion unless you are going to ride transit at least 4 times a day and hit at least 3+ of the expensive sites, you are not likely to save money.

ItalyTravel,"Gday all!

Hey, I asked here recently about some third wave coffee shops, and I've found the best coffee in Bologna. Actually no, I've found the best coffee in Italy I've had so far.

Look, Italian coffee is bitter, burnt and wakes you up with its ash and hot water taste, tempered by a sugar. I'm ok with it. It's functional. 

But, finding Aroma Speciality Coffees was genuinely one of my Bologna highlights!

Totally found by accident by it appearing on my Google Maps as I was looking for other stuff. Happy accident for sure.

Lady Owner and I talked about her beans' origins, their roast level, the acidity and tasting notes in her perfect English. She made recommendations on what I'd like - and what I might not like so much. And she was right on the money each time. Really knowledgeable and super info her third wave coffee. Genuinely, an absolute delight to be in her shop talking to her about coffee and trying her different beans.

I had them as double espressos, but I'll be going back today to try her V60 method.

I can't talk about her food yet, as I was too caught up with trying her coffee, but it looked standard cafe pastries that I'll try today as well. What I CAN say though, is that she had some single origin chocolate in her shop too. She offered me a square after the god-tier coffee, and GODDAMN it was good!! I will buy a bar of that too today.

In summary: The best coffee in Bologna, and the best coffee in Italy so far that I've had. Owner amazing. Go here if you're from Australia and want a good coffee. Also go here if you're over standard Italian espresso and want a coffee that is actually nice and tasty for a change.

Recommend A+++

ItalyTravel,"I went to the La Tagliata cooking class this weekend in positano after seeing videos of it on tiktok. It was very much what you see in the videos. It was a lot of fun and the food was decent. However, we got AWFUL food poisoning from it. My husband was on the plane the next day vomiting and having diarrhea that lasted until the next day after that. We are on our honeymoon and missed 2 days of it due to this illness. To confirm that it was from the cooking class, I reached out to another group of 12 people to see how they were feeling. They said their entire group has food poisoning as well. 

I reached out to the owners to express how we are very sick from their food and to request a refund because we had to miss 2 days of our trip. They responded very rudely and unprofessionally. She tried to say that no one else was sick but me and that I am making it up for money. I explained that the other group is sick. She said one girl was sick when she arrived from drinking the day before. I said that is a hangover that is not contagious. Then she said that I would’ve been sick during the class if it was from the food. The food wouldn’t have even been digested by then. Then she said I am not well traveled and probably do this all the time to get my money back. At this point I said I don’t care about the money and will leave a review.

It is what it is but anyway … for purposes of trying to get some sort of trip inconvenience money from my travel insurance, how do I get proof that the Frecca 9416 got cancelled?

ItalyTravel,"My Italy food review in case it helps anyone for trip planning. Sorry for any spelling errors:

Exceptional
- Romanè (Rome): Omg this was what we were looking for the entire trip! Just authentic Roman food without a crazy crowd. We got the polpette, zucchini, spaghetti all'amatriciana, fettuccine al tortellino, and pana cotta. Would recommend all of these!! Skip the bread though, kinda stale.

Great
- CiPASSO (Rome): everything we ordered was excellent except one terribly bland dish (squid ink pasta), which is why it's not in the exceptional category. Truffle pasta and burrata dish a must! Scallops and fry basket also tasty. 

- Suppli Roma (Rome): So affordable!!! Cacio E Pepe and Original suppli were great! Don't sleep on the fried zucchini and pizzas
 
- Osteria Olivia (Rome): Randomly stumbled into this place and was pleasantly surprised! Cacio E Pepe, carbonara and tiramisu were so good. I'm still thinking about the crispy pancetta from the carbonara...

- Gelateria Regusto (Rome): Random find in trastevere. Pistachio was very creamy!

- Starita (Naples): We got both the specials (starita marinara and the fried version) as well as mini fried pizzas. Everything was tasty and gluten free! Bit of a trek but you can take the train. Not too long of a wait.

- Ristorante Dei Cappuchini (Amalfi): Fine dining restaurant in our hotel. Everything was very well executed (albeit pricey)! We liked the risotto with raw prawns, cannelloni, and the bread spread.

- Vivoli (Florence): Yummy affogato! We got the pistachio. Line moved quickly.

Solid
- Lampredetto in Mercato Centrale (Florence): Can't find the place but it was v yummy! Cash preferred. So many good options in this market!

- Gelateria La Romana (Rome): Saw a lot of recs for this place on reddit. It was solid! They got my order wrong but whatever they gave me (pistachio and some kind of caramel flavor) was yummy and creamy.

- Seafood Attansio Roma (Rome): Fried anchovies and salmon arranchini were  crispy and fresh.

- Pizzeria Dal Presidente - Sede Storica (Naples): Solid random find for neopolitan pizza. Service not great and kinda confusing how to enter the restaurant.

Meh
- All'Antico (Florence): Maybe too overhyped? It was good not great. We went to the one in the Florence train station to avoid the big lines. The mortadella was reallyyyy good, but the pistachio cream and cheese combo was slightly lacking somehow. My husband got the vegetarian #2 and was v unhappy with his. They did give us free fresh foccacia while we were ordering though and that was great!

- Trattoria Sabatino (Florence): Definitely amazing prices but nothing blew us away. Lots of locals were eating here but ordering off menu. The off menu stuff looked way better :< we got minestrone, 3 types of pasta, the florentine steak, potatoes and tomatoes. The staff kept coming over to warn us of various things, like how the steak would be RARE (we knew this, but some pieces at the ends of the steak I couldn't cut through, whereas the middle was perfectly fine. Overall needed more even cooking and a better sear), the minestrone is not what you think (blended soup with rice vibes which I didn't fully understand till it came out. Still yummy) and that we ordered to much food (they were right, could've cut 1-2 pastas and the potatoes). Overall we didn't mind their suggestions! We just weren't super impressed by the food. We waited 30 mins before opening to secure a spot in line to guarantee a table. By the time we left, there was a massive line.

- Taverna degli Apostoli (Amalfi): Really underwhelmed by the seasoning for all the pasta dishes. The best thing was the sea bream!

Other foods we had randomly that's probably good anywhere you get it 
- Maritozzo con Pana (Rome)
- Mixed Fry (Amalfi)
- Lemon Sorbet (Amalfi): They will charge you a lot cause they can :///
 
Did not make it to sadly 
- Dar Filettaro a Santa Barbara (Rome): Only open for dinner so we messed up timing wise :( 
- Scialla The Original Street Food (Rome): This one we were so sad about. We ordered our food only to realize how far we were from the Vatican and had to leave to make our tour, and they don't allow takeaway. We still paid (cash only) and the staff were very kind. 
- Vin e vicchi Sapori (Florence): Hard to make a res. Try to stop by in person as soon as you can to make a dinner res for your last night or something :/ They don't pick up the phone always.

I actually left my stuff on beaches all over Puglia and didn’t have any problems. When possible I tried not to bring my phone and wallet, but since I was solo and had a rental car for part of the trip usually it seemed safer to bring my stuff (passport, car keys, money for the day, phone, etc.) down to the beach when I was swimming than leave it in the car. I did buy a dry-bag (in Italy, lesson learned) but it leaked and I didn’t want my rental car keys to end up at the bottom of the sea if it failed completely.

ItalyTravel,"5 days in Rome! 

I got most of my information from the [Girls Love Travel Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/share/jB8jzgU178RheZKh/?mibextid=K35XfP) - didn’t realize this sub existed until a few days before i left for Rome. Here is a culmination of all that help, along with watching a lot of tik toks! Two content creators that helped were [Jackie Camarado](https://www.tiktok.com/@jackiecamardo?_t=8nZk2oTWeAI&_r=1) and “[Local Aromas](https://www.tiktok.com/@localaromas?_t=8nZjvxmWjs2&_r=1)”. I’ll post some photos in the comments.

Day 1: 
- I had an Icelandair flight to Rome and their service is always great. I have flown both their regular economy and saga premium and if you can bid on an upgrade or have points, saga premium is 100% worth it. Took the train and streetcar from Airport to Monastery. I was pretty iffy about staying at a monastery (I’m a Marriott or Airbnb if necessary gal) but really enjoyed it! The breakfast was light but all i needed. Just like a hotel, they came and changed your towels and made your bed every day. I felt very safe. Someone was always working the desk. There was also no curfew. The price truly can’t be beat. 
- Postcards from Fox Gallery. Such cute postcards and books. If you have a little kid and want them to learn Italian, they had so many kids books. 
- Spritz at Il Tagliere Toscano (!!) - super cheap,Great for people watching. 
- Elysium- for apps and drink, Amazing classic frittatina
- Roscioli - highly raved about online. Amazing service. Little pricey but worth it. 

Day 2: 
- Walked around Rome in the morning before 12pm reservation at coleseeum. Had a nice quiet walk around palatine hill. 
- Got a Coffee at Antico Caffè Greco. Amazing coffee. Very quiet in the morning. 
- Walked around the shopping area. Has amazing experience at the Longchamp store and also the Louis Vuitton on Via Dei Condotti. SA Jennifer was very patient as I was looking for multiple items. Unfortunately the online inventory wasn’t accurate for in store but she gave me stores that had the items i wanted in stock. I went to the larger Louis Vuitton on San Lorenzo and they had not a lot in stock as well. 
- I purchased 12pm entry at the coleseeum. This was the earliest time they had unfortunately. I wish i would have gotten the self guided audio tour. I don’t feel like i got as much of the history as i wanted to. There were so many tour groups and overall it was very overwhelming and crowded. 
- Antica Enoteca - very good! Super close to where i was staying. 

Day 3:
- Coffee at l’antico caffè della pigna. Epitome of hole in the wall. The staff were very friendly and attentive. 
- purchased a 12pm tour at the Vatican. I’m very happy that i bought the audio tour through the Vatican versus a third party. The queue situation / figuring out where to go is kinda challenging but i just kept walking towards the front. I had an amazing tour guide. It was her 14th year being a tour guide and she was so knowledgeable. I dressed very modestly but was surprised that others did not. I wasn’t sure if people wouldn’t be allowed into St Peters Bascilla if they were dressed “immodestly” but they were. The tour was about 2 hours. While not religious, i very much enjoyed it as there’s a lot to learn about the history of the Vatican City and overall the Pope. I came on a Tuesday when the Pope did not come out. I read he comes and greets the public Wednesday mornings. 
- Had dinner at Osteria Pizzeria di Agrippa. They had an amazing wine selection and i really enjoyed my meal. The wait staff were very attentive as well. 

Day 4:
- Went to Brandy Melville. With it being so popular in the US, I assumed it was a US Store. Watched a short video and it’s actually an Italian brand. Prices are similar to what they are in America and still very typical “one size” fits none bullshit but i ended up buying something 🤷🏼‍♀️
- Stumbled across Negresso bocca di leone for lunch. I loved my food and overall was a great experience. 
- Bought sunglasses at Gucci. I didn’t get my SAs name but she was super helpful! 
- Then walked to the Spanish steps. I hadn’t worked out in a while due to being ill before my trip and i felt it after walking up those steps. Walk that a few days of your trip and you’ll be fit af. It was a nice view at the top. 
- The 3 days of non stop fun got to me so i spent about half the afternoon “rotting” in bed. It felt good to sleep in a bit. 
- Got gelato at vale gelato. Super yummy. 

Day 5:
- Coffee at Sant Eustachio il caffe. My first iced coffee of the trip. The basic American in me was living. 
- had a ticket for the Pantheon. However come to find out, i actually bought a voucher through Bascilla of San Lorenzo of Lucina. The ticket pickup process was easy. However i waited in a longer line inside the pantheon to get my audio device for the tour. The worker did say you could download their app and it was similar but about half the time. Again, i enjoyed this because of the history but i thought there’d be more on the inside. (I had no historical knowledge besides knowing it was a big building). Just like The Vatican, people did not follow the dress code but were not asked to leave or denied entry. 
- I followed everyone’s rules and packed light (1 suitcase for 3 weeks) but after 5 days i needed to do laundry. I found White cloud Laundrette on Apple Maps and it was very easy to drop off. €18 to wash, dry, and fold! 
- lunch at Tassoni. Either a tourist trap or an off day at this restaurant. Pizza was meh and aperol spritz was rather bitter. 
- Worked at ex circus. Great environment. Quiet. 
- Dinner at emma. Very meh. Would not recommend. 

Random thoughts:
- I am very anti smoking but surprisingly the Italian cigarettes / vapes don’t bother me. Wonder what they’re putting in our American shit 🤨
- It was very funny to see tour guides with the large “sticks” to help their group identify them. Reminded me of going to music festivals / raves in the US. 
- There is, surprisingly but also not, a large military presence throughout Rome. Didn’t bother me one way or another but it was something i noticed. 
- The city can be loud at night with cars and birds. It has a similar “sound” to Chicago and NYC. If you are a light sleeper, you DEFINITELY need ear plugs. I’m not a light sleeper but woke up a few times to some birds. 

Overall i had an amazing time! I think 5 days in Rome is good if you’re wanting to do the touristy spots. I spent most of my time in the Pigna and Colonna (i think) areas. If i had more time i would definitely go check out Trastevere and do a day trip to Pompeii. It wasn’t too hot during my time here (85F/30C most days).

ItalyTravel,"Recently came back from a two week trip in southern Italy. My trip started in Rome then took a train to Vico Equense where we based ourself for several days. We explored the area using the train system and ferries.
 We then rented a vehicle to drive to Puglia. Be aware that there will be tolls and you need to stop at the toll booths to get a biglietto (ticket). Since we didn’t speak the language we drove right through the (edit: yellow telepass lane) and thought they would charge the rental car company which would then charge us. Big mistake! We were fined 95 euro when trying to exit the toll for not having a ticket. Other friends made the same mistake but were only charged the toll cost of approx 20 euro. 
Lesson learned for us, but wanted to save other travelers the stress. Go through the “Biglietto” lane and get a ticket.

I got strawberries and whipped cream (€12) and when I was paying he was hiding the price he charged me and I looked at my receipt and I was charged €25. I asked and he all of a sudden couldn’t understand English and said “Sorry, My manager” and threw up his hands.

Then kept pressuring my coworkers to tip.

ItalyTravel,"Wrapping up a stay in this beautiful town. If you’ve been to La Jolla, that’s the vibe - but so much classier! In town is very busy and very focused on tourist shops, but clean and no graffiti (came from Napoli, so quite the contrast). A few things we did:
1. Lemon orchard tour - north end of town, a larger lemon orchard (full production process) ending with a walk to the bluff overlooking the ocean. We loved it because it was a private tour, focused on local production, and gets you away from the shopping district
2. Pizza making in the hills above Sorrento- great experience, the pizza chef was a lot of fun and we ended with lunch on the patio with another spectacular view
3. Capri- maybe an off day but we were on a smaller boat that was tossed pretty good going over. One guest was seasick the whole way and everyone but us took a larger ferry back. It is packed with tourists- not for us. If you go, bring towels (I got soaked on the boat just from sea spray), ponchos, hats and Dramamine. Glad we went - wouldn’t repeat
4. Salerno - day trip from Sorrento, and we had a terrific guided tour. Salerno is NOT a tourist destination- and that made it even more enjoyable for us. A lot to see, and if you’re wanting genuine experience, this is it.
5. Lunch - one of our best in over 4 weeks in Southern Italy- La Cantinaccia del Popolo. You won’t believe it from the outside, then when you get your food, you will understand. 
6. Dinner - We had several fancy dinners, typically top floors of hotels. The better the view, the more meh the food. One place with no view and great food was Il Buco. 

Sorrento definitely worth the visit, but try to get out of town to experience the local flavor of this wonderful place. If you want specifics on the above, DM me ",t2_fm57ua1iq,5 days in Sorrento,0.95,18,1717254654.0,1717254654.0,20,EOW2025,1d5p4dk

ItalyTravel,"I couldn't find tons of info on here of Pompeii so I wanted to share my experience for anyone planning trips. I went in mid April and it was pretty busy already, cannot even imagine how busy it would be during peak season.

I stayed in Sorrento and took the circumvensia train for 2,40. It took 40 minutes. Beware there is no air conditioning on the train and can be quite full at peak times. The train station is right outside the entrance -pompeii scavi NOT pompeii. If you are coming via trentalia train, that stop is on the opposite side of the site.
I booked a 2 hour guided tour through Askos for €50 the night before going. It was 100% worth it. Our guide was so informative and funny and covered quite a bit of ground in the 2 hours. 

 I spent another 3 hours in my park on my own using the audio guide offered on their app and I felt my time was not nearly as effective or informative. The app does not work well, so if you want to go the audio guide route, get the physical ones they offer. The site is giant (over 100 acres). You will not be able to see every single thing, but I feel like in 5 hours I saw enough. It was amazing and my favorite part of my trip, including my time in Rome, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I didn't get the tour.

A few other notes: bring a reusable water bottle- there are Roman fill stations throughout the site. Wear good walking shoes (I walked 8k in my 5 hours there) , a hat and sunscreen because theres very little shade, and some snacks.

We booked a 5 hour food tour with [Culinary Backstreets](https://culinarybackstreets.com/tours-food-tours/tours-naples/2017/beyond-walls-day-life-neapolitan-market-neighborhood/) and had Sonia as our tour guide. It was everything we wanted and more! The ""backstreets"" part of their name is no joke. She took us to these super small, local businesses where we got to interact with the owners (most of whom were running their family businesses in their 4th or 5th generation!). We of course got to eat so many delicious and unique food that we never would have thought to try. I'm not sure if they're all like this, but I booked the tour for 2 people and it was just my husband, Sonia, and me so it was a great intimate experience and we got to ask her as many questions as we wanted! 

Sonia is an absolute treasure trove of history not only of Naples food and culture but of Italy in general. She knew so much, we could have listened to her forever. She's a born and raised Napolitana and has so much love and pride for the city, it made everything that much more special! Seriously - you have to do this tour if you come to Naples. We've been living and travelling in Italy for 3 months and this will definitely be a highlight of our entire time here. Please do it!

ItalyTravel,"Just finished a ten day trip in Italy for the first time. Just wanted to drop my thoughts. This is from the view of an American who is fluent in Spanish and can speak a tiny bit of Italian.

Rome - we had a great time here and the history is a little mind blowing. We took taxis, Uber or walked everywhere and never had an issue with taxis. Used the train to get from FCO to Termini. 

Sorrento/Naples - We rented a car and left Rome. As far as driving if you are a confident driver in super tights spaces and can handle a little road anarchy you’ll be fine. Having the car allowed us some freedom to explore some off the beaten paths items. Amalfi was way greener than I was expecting. It was gorgeous, but I felt like all the little towns all basically sold the same stuff. I thought Sorrento was a good base for the area. More restaurants and has all the same shopping as the other towns. My favorite was just hiking around. 

Abruzzo - We went off the beaten path staying here. It was the most authentic experience and there wasn’t much English spoken. Also beautiful and green, but very different and the regional food was all about black truffles, wild boar, and sheep kebobs. It was all awesome. 

All our meals were great and we already miss the food!

I loved the Italians. They were all great. The only people we had issues with were other tourists or some of the people trying to sell you garbage outside the tourist areas. Saw pickpockets once outside of the colosseum. That was it. ",t2_13310n,Trip Report - Time to go back,0.9,16,1729976119.0,1729976119.0,8,slade45,1gcuou4

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone, just got back yesterday from my fantastic 13 nights in Italy and I just want to share the love like everyone else with some overall thoughts, advice, and why you all are really here the restaurant recommendations.

So first off let me say that Italy lived up to every single expectation and then still spilled over the cup. Truly Italy has to be the quintessential travel destination in the world, it’s really that good. The food, people, and all the cities are divine.

My recommendation if you are going is to make sure to see Rome and Florence. I can not possibly imagine a first time trip where you only see one city. They are both the same side of the coin and you will be making a big mistake by only going to one. Let me repeat that, do not go to Italy unless you can see both Rome and Florence! 

But I get it, sometimes it really might not be possible, so if you had to only go to one for a first visit to Italy, pick Rome just for the simple fact that there are more things to see.

And like most people, if I were to ever return (I’m sure I will) Florence seems like the better option because while there are still tons of tourists it doesn’t feel as touristy as Rome.

The only negatives I can bring up is that day tripping to Venice is a bad idea and if you are serious about seeing it, I’d say 2 nights is mandatory to make sure you can get off the main tourist paths and see the other islands. Also the central market area of Florence is kind of depressing because there are too many vendors with stalls trying to sell junk. 

The best surprises of the trip actually came in Rome. I forgot about the wild parakeets and it kind of blew my mind, also Rome is more green than you would think, the City does a terrific job of incorporating trees and plants. 

Now to why you are all here, the food, let me say the food culture is maybe the best in the world, I only had one subpar meal which was still pretty good all things considered, and while I could list 90 percent of the places I ate at, I will give you only the best to make your decisions that much easier.

Rome:

Antico Arco - now I found this from Reddit actually and this place is more of a fine dining contemporary restaurant, it is good no question but it is on top of Janiculum Hill which needs to be on your itinerary so walk up the hill and see beautiful Rome and then eat a beautiful meal

Carpo de Fero Roma - This is in Trastevere and it seems like this is a super local and authentic place, im pretty sure this was the best pasta I had in Rome 

Otaleg - Gelato place actually right next to Carpo de Fero that was my favorite Gelato in Rome

Fiordiluna - Another gelato place in Trastevere that was wonderful

Gelateria La Romana - Gelato in more center of Rome, had the most unique flavors out of any store I went 

Florence: 

Antica Trattoria da Tito - best pasta I had in Florence

Gelateria Artigianale La Sobeterria - my favorite gelato shop in all of Italy close to Santa Maria church 

Cinque Terre specifically Monterosso:

Da Eraldo: Good seafood dishes especially the seafood pasta 

Venice: 

Bar All’Acro - By Rialto bridge super famous and for good reason, the ciccheta were amazing  

Bologna:

Leonida - No shit this was actually the best meal I had in all of Italy and this was a place I stumbled upon. The place I wanted to go was called Grasili and was completely booked out so maybe go there too if you get a chance. Anyways this place had the best sun dried tomatoes I’ve ever had, the eggplant parm was heaven, the pasta bolognese was easily divine and one of the top three pastas I had the entire time, the panna cotta was also maybe the best of the entire trip, and out of all the places I got lemoncello at this was the only place that served the glass actually frozen not just chilled which made a big difference.

If any locals know if this place is actually one of the better restaurants in Bologna do tell because if this is somehow average then holy shit.

Either way if you are a serious foodie Bologna has to go on your places to visit while in Italy.

ItalyTravel,"Follow up Post sharing my thoughts on our month-long trip through Italy. 

We left Rome and picked up our rental car at FCO. Pretty smooth process.  We received through AutoEurope and ended up with a car through Budget. We then hit the road for Tuscany. 

On the way, we decided to stop in Orvieto.  Turned out to be a great choice. Orvieto was beautiful.  A wonderful Duomo with beautiful mosaics and a wonderful piazza out front.  Advise you to check it out if you are in the area.  We had a wonderful lunch at a local panino shop (Amazing porchetta!) Il Negozietto.  Great choice. 

We made it to Greve in Chianti as our base for the next 4 nights. We stayed at a very nice agritourismo Borge del Cabreo https://www.borgodelcabreo.it/ just above the town of Greve. Beautiful grounds with a pool. Breakfast included with your room.  They also have a sister property down the road with a ristorante plus a winery outside of town. Great place to stay. 

Tuscany Day 2
We went the small town of Lamole and had an amazing lunch at Ristoro di Lamole.    
http://www.ristorodilamole.it/. Great food, great service, great views. 

After lunch, we did a wine tasting at Tenuta di Nozzole. This is the winery connected to our agritourismo.  The wine was very good, and the grounds were beautiful. We ended up buying a case of wine to be shipped home.  Afterward, we went to Enoteca Falorni in Greve. They have over 1,000 bottles of wine for sale and over 100 wines by the glass.  

For the record, we are very in to wine and this will be a common theme for our trip. 

Dinner that night was at La Cantina Pizzeria in Greve.  Great pizza and very reasonably priced.   

Tuscany Day 3
We headed to San Gimignano, the famous walled city.  Not impressed.   The architecture and towers were incredible but the village was overwhelmed with tourists.  Not fun.  I think this is the influence of TikTok and all the damn influencers.  

On the way back, we stopped by Castello di Verrazzano for a wine tasting.   Fantastic property and great wines.  Yes, this is the same Verrazzano that has a bridge named after him in New York. 

Dinner that night at another restaurant in Greve, Enoteca Ristorante Gallo Nero. Excellent. 

Tuscany Day 4
We had a planned tour with a guide which included wine tasting and a castle tour. On the way to meet up, we stopped by the village of Panzano.  Another in a long list of great walled cities in Tuscany. Charming village and not very crowded. Very enjoyable visit. 

We did the tour and wine tasting at Monterinaldi Winery with our guide.  Great facility and great wine.  More wine getting sent home.  Next we headed to Brolio Castle, which has been in the same family for 600 years. Some of the best views in Tuscany we have seen yet.  

Dinner that night at La Cantinetta di Rignana. Another in a long list of wonderful dinners we have had during this trip.  

Observations
- For all the Americans on here, no more complaining about gas prices.  We paid €1.94 a liter.  This works out to over $8 a gallon. Wow. 

- Not sure if this is normal weather for April in Tuscany but lots of rain and cold. 

- Driving here is quite the adventure with the tight mountain roads and hairpin turns. The weather has definitely not helped.    Just take your time and make room for oncoming traffic.  And don’t be surprised if the road suddenly becomes a dirt road. 

Next Stop- Siena and Montepulciano

ItalyTravel,"i just finished my european trip and we spend a week in Italy based in Milan.

we did 3 day trips in total : Lake Como (Varenna-Bellagio) , St Moritz via Tirano, Cinque Terre

other days we just chill in Milan visiting local sites such as the last supper museum , duomo , watching football and so on

as this is my first time in Milan, my opinion :

\- i do offered corn to feed the birds by a man in front of duomo but he's never aggresive and i actually observe them interacting with other tourists and even helpful sometimes (well they get a few euros ofc)

\- i saw the ""dice guessing"" scam group behind Sforzesco castle (in the bridge going to the park) but at this point everyone should know this as its not limited to milan or italy

\- most people we met here are very nice and warm (waitress, train staff, random people in the street when i cant find something)

\- we feel safe in Milan even when walking at night (ofc your miles may vary, we are not LV-touting tourists)

\- the train to malpensa is expensive (13 euro one way, 20 return)

\- Monumentale Cemetery is very beautiful, feels like an open-air sculpture gallery.

\- its beautiful there and i  wish i had more time in italy

Lake Como: its perfect for day trip from milan

St Moritz: the bernina line does offer amazing view and we took the normal non-bernina train and its way better as we an open the window and take pics/videos. but a day is actually feel too rushed (we only had about 3 to 4 hours in st moritz itself)

ItalyTravel,"I just wanted to share my 2 cents worth on purchasing tickets with GetYourGuide.  We are just finishing up our trip to Italy.  We purchased a few tickets through them and upon closer examination I noticed a few things.    


For Pantheon tickets, they charged us for 4 tickets(2 adults + 2 kids) but when I walked up, I noticed that kids don’t require any tickets.  Further the actual cost of the tickets to purchase were  €5x2  but I got charged $53 so I got fleeced there once.   We just finished the Borghese Gallery, the tickets were €12/person but they ended up charging us about $40/person.   I understand everybody needs to make a living and people need to mark up, but these are a bit on the outrageous side.

Honestly the fault is totally on me, I really should have spent a few more minutes researching and buying tickets from the Italian web site directly rather than going through a broker.  It just feels a bit annoyed being taken for a ride.    They really do make it super easy for somebody coming from the USA to buy a ticket.  Their app is excellent, their search works great, they have a really nice cancellation system and pick your time slot for offerings that offer that capability.  It really simplifies things for us US chumps quite nicely so I guess I paid the price for it.    


I just hope some other people find this post useful when they are planning a trip to Europe and stumble upon GetYourGuide.

ItalyTravel,"There were some STRONG opinions and I was downvoted to hell [when I posted here a couple months back asking if I should skip Rome on this trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/18srpla/would_we_be_crazy_to_skip_rome/?utm_source=share). (The people who commented if it was a troll post- really?…) I said I would report back after, so here I am!

**Summary: It went fantastically. My mom had, in her words, the “best time in her life.” I was nervous throughout that we would regret not hitting Rome up, but in the end, no one had any regrets, and a city we would’ve had to skip if going to Rome, ended up being everyone’s favorite (Florence).**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

##Background
3 people total (my mom, brother, myself). This was preceded by a few days in Ireland (cheapest way for us to get to Europe), and a couple in France, but Italy was the majority of the trip. My mom recently retired, so this was in celebration of that, as well as a stressful year for her of dealing with a cancer diagnosis. Her dream since a young girl was to visit France and Italy. Since we didn’t have unlimited time, we mutually came to the decision to focus on Italy for this trip. Life is short, so although we’re not usually the rapid type of travelers, we did want to hit up multiple spots since this could be the first and last time we’ll be in Italy.

I'll put the itinerary and notes and the end of this post since that's the longest part.

Small rant: Some people on the last post complained about the amount of time for this trip, but there’s clearly a lot of privileged folks in this subreddit. We’re lucky enough to be able to afford this trip and take the time away from work and home life to have made this happen. The majority of people in the world cannot travel for weeks or a month at a time, so we have to work with what we have. People also thought I was crazy for choosing this time of year; again, most people do not have the ability to travel whenever they want. Christmas/New Years time is when we have some time off already. We historically like traveling in the off-peaks as well as this allows us to miss the crazy crowding and expense of traveling in summer.

##Costs
**Roughly $1k USD per person, per week (not including flights).**
All accommodations were well-reviewed and at least 4-stars. Had some nice dinners, usually had drinks with meals. Not a super budget trip, but was not an extravagant one either, so I would consider this on the mid-range but still budget-conscious side of things. I can break this down into more detail if desired.

##Weight impact
We ate a lot, we walked a ton. For the two of us that do track our weight:
- Mom: No change. She expected to be up. Background: moderately overweight, lightly active, and drinks regularly in normal life.
- Myself: \~3 pound weight gain. Hard to judge exact amount since I was also visiting family before this trip, but, the majority of the time away was spent in Italy, and I definitely ate the most there. Background: slim/average weight, lightly active and count calories in normal life. Drink once a week at most in normal life, in contrast to how I drank every day on this trip (I’m talking a wine at lunch/dinner, not drunk every day lol).

We travelled to Spain for about the same length of time several years ago and both lost weight, so this was a disappointment. But Spain was definitely smaller portions and less carb-heavy than Italy.

##Downsides:

1. Timing. Being there immediately after New Year, during the Jan. 6 holiday, and during tourist low season meant MANY times, things like restaurants that were supposedly open according to Google Maps, were closed. Got burned by this in the other two countries on our trip as well, so this wasn’t unique to Italy, so we learned to have \*multiple\* backup options for every destination.
2. Weather. Was a bit rainy throughout the trip, but it was full-on stormy in Sorrento for all but one day, which was a particular bummer since that was the one place we decided to spend more for a nice place, whose highlight was the huge outdoor terrace with a beautiful view, that we didn’t get to use due to said storminess/raininess.
3. For me only: Being in “tour guide” mode constantly. I was basically the sole organizer for everything, from flights to food plans, getting directions on Google maps, etc…. so it sometimes felt more like work than a vacation to me, haha.

##Learnings for next time
- Always be at full vigilance re: taxis. We got scammed on literally our last taxi in Italy. Nothing major (maybe €20-25 lost), but still annoying. Our hotel (4 star, major, international chain) in Naples reserved us a taxi the night before; my guard was down the next morning since of course, you would assume all is official in this situation. But, didn’t see a meter once inside, no other usual taxi signage inside, and he was missing a card reader (which the front desk confirmed we wanted the night before), and were ultimately charged €35 for a 9 minute ride.
- **Book trains in advance!!** I knew prices were higher if you don’t, but I didn’t realize *how* much higher. Because of this, trains ended up being a large chunk of our expenses and we probably spent twice as much than we would’ve otherwise. (I didn’t book advance because our itinerary was not exact/I wanted to leave us the flexibility to change plans. I should’ve checked if rescheduling is easy/free and just booked us advance tickets)

##Other notes
- General scams/pickpocketing: We expected to encounter more of this and were prepared for it, but surprisingly, all went super smoothly! We were approached by one of the African friendship bracelet guys in Venice, but literally nothing else besides this.

#Itinerary
###**Day 1: Milan**
Arrive to Milan via plane. Why? Cheapest flights were into Milan.We arrived early so we got the whole day in Milan, and stayed at a nice Airbnb by the metro. The Christmas market was still open, which was a nice surprise!

###**Day 2-3: Venice**
Got train in the morning from Milan to Venice. Amazing little family-run BnB right over the canals, super affordable too. Tons of walking. Did the usual gondola ride, of course. Touristy, but worth it.

I was totally surprised how crowded Venice was, given how quiet everywhere else on the trip had been so far. Crowds of people– I can’t imagine what it must be like in the summer. Also, VERY glad we did not visit in the summer due to the mosquitoes as well. Still had some mosquito trouble in our BnB despite it not even being mosquito season.

Despite just staying here one night, we didn’t feel we were missing out on a ton by not staying longer, but we thought it was well-worth making it out to Venice. I personally don’t feel the need to go out of the way to visit again, but if I do, it will most definitely NOT be during the summer.

###**Day 3-5: Florence**
Got train in morning from Venice to Florence. Again, amazing BnB, looking right out to the Duomo. Did a walking tour here, unfortunately we missed the latter portion of it since we had to run to our dinner reservation (4 Leoni! Delicious).

I didn’t expect the wine windows to be open based on my research beforehand, but there was one open that we visited later, thanks to the insight from our walking tour guide! One of my mom's highlights, for sure. We did visit the statue of David, but didn’t do any museums besides this.

**This ended up being our favorite city on the trip.** Was a great mix of good food, sights, shopping, and general vibe (not too big of a city, but still lots to do).

###**Day 5-8: Sorrento/Amalfi Coast**
Day 5 was largely a travel day, which was a drag. Train from Florence to Naples. Because of the train delay, we missed the Sorrento train (Circumvesuviana) by literally about 30s, so we had to wait \~40 minute in the Naples train station in the mean time. Definitely the sketchiest/grungiest part of the trip at that point. The Circumvesuviana train itself was fine, just dirty. It was raining when we got into Sorrento, and ended up raining pretty regularly until our last day.

We stayed at an Airbnb, which was on the top floor and had a terrace overlooking the ocean and with a view of Mt. Vesuvius. Sadly, we didn’t get to make use of it due to the rain (once things cleared up, the furniture and such was still wet from the previous days’ rains). Our Airbnb was located close to downtown, so we spent a lot of time just wandering around in between the rains. And during the rain, finally caught up on laundry since luckily this place did have a washing machine!

*We essentially had 3 full days here.* First day was a bit of a wash due to the storming, but second day we rolled the dice and decided to give **Pompeii** a try. (Back to the Circumvesuviana!) And we were glad we did! The rain didn’t stop completely the rest of that day, but it was quite light once we got there. Pompeii was pretty empty, and turned out that day was a free admission day too, which was an extra nice bonus!! We got there in the afternoon so we stayed until closing time, but we could’ve gladly spent more time there if we were able to. We wished we had learned a bit more about Pompeii beforehand– we had a great time there as is, but we would’ve been able to enjoy it even more if we had deeper historic knowledge.

Third day, knowing we had lost a bit of time due to the bad weather while in Sorrento, we decided to do **one big splurge to finish out our time in Italy– a private tour of the Amalfi Coast**. Ended up being well worth the cost, and not much more expensive than if we had joined a group tour. And of course was infinitely times more convenient than if we tried to DIY it via the local bus. (Sorrento-Positano ferries are closed in the winter) On top of that, it also saved us the hassle of getting back to Naples (we had a 7am flight the next morning)- the Sorrento-Naples ferry had been closed due to choppy seas, so we were either going to have to rush back to catch the Naples airport bus, begrudgingly take the Circumvesuviana, or fork up the €€€ for the hour-long taxi. Instead, our tour driver was able to drop us off in Naples rather than back to Sorrento at the end of the tour. 

We stopped in several of the cities along the Amalfi Coast. **Had an AMAZING lunch in Ravello, holy moly the views.** I think that was my favorite city that day. Least favorite: Amalfi. Positano was super quiet, barely any tourists, very unique and beautiful place though. If I was to come to this region again, I think I would still choose Sorrento as home base. It was very easy to see how absolutely chaotic these places would be in the peak tourist times though.

###**Day 8-9: Naples**
Basically were here just to spend the night, due to our flight departing at 7am (!) the final day, so we didn’t really do much. Arrived from Sorrento around 6pm, so just got dinner by our hotel, and relaxed from the long day. Definitely a different vibe from everywhere else we had been on the trip. Saw some homeless here, which we realized we hadn’t seen at all through the rest of our time in Italy.

ItalyTravel,"Hello reddit! 

I've never been to Europe before, but I'm gearing up for a visit to Italy in the 2nd week of September. For the most part, I've got the broad strokes taken care of-- I'm gonna spend a few days in Rome, then a few days in Venice. Got hotel reservations way in advance, and I've been watching a lot of Rick Steves and other travel vids on Youtube for basic pointers. Though on the flipside my overactive imagination makes me think that by wearing a hat, the pickpockets will instantly mark me as a tourist and lift my passport without me noticing until it's too late. I also understand it's probably not gonna be that bad, but again, overactive imagination. 

This said, I figured I'd turn to dashing and experienced travelers like you for more advice. 

For one, I plan on taking the train from Rome to Venice, but I haven't bought tickets in advance just yet. I understand the main options are Italo and Trenitalia-- would you recommend one over the other? What about the 'classes' or levels or whatever? Is it worth upgrading to a fancier seat? 

Also, I've heard that the olive oil we get in the US isn't nearly as good as ""the real stuff"" that they use in Italy, possibly because the Mafia has a racket and waters it down or something. As such, I was thinking about getting a bottle of Italian olive oil to bring back-- any recommendations on brand, or would I be able to pick something up at any corner grocery, or even at the airport? 

And! What's the weather usually like in Italy (specifically, Rome and Venice) in mid-September? Should I expect it to be more summer sun, or should I plan on bringing a rain jacket and/or a sweatshirt? 

I'm sure I'll think of more questions as soon as I hit 'post.' Still, looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. Thanks! ",t2_aclunne2,Tips for a first-time traveler? ,0.86,16,1724678549.0,1724678549.0,26,HeartInYourBoots,1f1o34k

ItalyTravel,"We just came back from a trip to Italy. Started in Rome.

Spent 5 nights in Rome. Could have shortened it to 4 nights. Kept an extra night since was traveling with the baby for the first time and was not sure how fussy she might be. We had pre booked tours for Colosseum, Vatican and Pantheon. We kept it to one guided tour a day and spent rest of the time roaming around and trying out food. We were staying at walkable distance to Pantheon and about 30 min walk to Colosseum. It was about 15 min walk to Vatican. Luckily the weather was not hot for most part of our time in Rome. As for food, we did like Piccolo Bucco for Pizza.  Did end up eating a lot of Pistachio croissant. 

From Rome we travelled to Cinque Terre and stayed there for two nights. We took Intercity Trenitalia to La Spezia and from there took a regional train. We stayed in Riomaggiore. It was the most peaceful village. Regional train tickets do need validation. We took a day pass for traveling between the villages. Our favorite was Vernazza for visiting. Some of the villages have lifts from station to the village. I would recommend getting airbnb near the lifts. These are paid and cost us 2 euro per adult. This saved us a lot of hassle with getting our stuff to the apartment. Trains run late sometimes so it is best to validate the tickets for the regional trains only sometime before you are about to board. 

From here we went next to Florence where we spent 3 nights . We did a stopover at Pisa for 3 hours. There is a luggage check in at the station. Cost about 5 Euro per bag. From Pisa we took a regional train to Florence. We stayed very close to the station at Florence. We booked a guided tour for Uffizi and David here.  We also did a tour of the Duomo and a 5 hour wine tasting tour. Florence ended up being our favorite city on the trip. We loved food at ZaZa.  We did find a lot of street side shops claiming to sell leather goods. Do your own research before deciding to buy leather goods here. I would recommend going up the Piazza Michelangelo. The views were amazing and it’s pretty doable. 

We spent one night post Florence in Venice. Venice looks nice when you are coming into the hotels in a boat but I found it not that charming otherwise. Lots of stores and shops make it feel like more of a market like any other place. We did end up buying some Murano glass earrings and pendants here. We did ask to check for card saying it is authentic Murano glass. That’s the best we could do to check for authenticity. 

We spent 2 nights in Milan and did a day trip to Lake Como area. 

In general do book the non regional trains early enough. We checked the prices for fun from Venice to Milan and it was more than 2x of what we had paid. We had booked our trains about 10-14 days before the start of the trip. 

No one checked our passports once we were in Italy.  But we did carry them around. 

We did not see many bracelet or rose scams which it seemed to me was commonplace based on some other posts. 

We carried a travel stroller which could be folded. We even saw a lot of people with strollers in Cinque Terre. We had not carried it from our airbnb in CT when visiting the villages.  But in hindsight should have carried.  

100 tiramisu and two sizes are over hyped in my opinion. Try tiramisu in some local restaurants.  

Cappuccino- I have seen so many instagram posts about not ordering it post noon. But I saw it on numerous occasions and myself did order it post noon and most places seemed fine with the idea. 

All in all Italy is doable with a baby. We saw plenty of new parents and their baby on the trip.

Here was my itinerary:

- 2 nights in Dorgali/Cala Gonone
  - 1st day was a travel day so we just hung out in Dorgali and got dinner. We stayed at a beautiful B&B called Palazzo Santa Caterina which I couldn’t recommend enough. 
  - 2nd day we rented a boat in Cala Gonone which lived the hype. It was a dream and we spent all day exploring the gulf. 

- 3 nights in Sant’Antioco
   - 3rd day we drove from Dorgali to Sant’Antioco in the South as I wanted to experience more Sardinian culture and get off the the tourist path a little. This town was very charming and I loved it. It was very quiet but I really enjoyed how peaceful it was. 
  - 4th day we day tripped to Cagliari and spent a half day there. Had amazing lunch at Locanda Leonildo dal Buongustaio. Later we drove back to Sant’Antioco for sunset at Calasetta. 
  - 5th day we drive to Porto Flavia and did a guided boat tour. This surpassed my expectations and our guide was amazing. He loved Sardinia and shared great history with us. Couldn’t recommend enough. Later that day we drive back to explore the west side of Sant’Antioco which was so cool! Very rural and wild. The old volcanic rocks were awesome to hike. Arco dei Baci and Cala Grotta were amazing. It was so windy so we couldn’t swim but definitely go if you’re near. 
  
- 3 nights in Capo d’Orso
  - 6th day long drive to Capo d’orso and hike the Capo D’orso. Kind of touristy but we were staying close and it was a beautiful view. Very easy quick hike. The guy working there recommend us to check out Capo Testa for sunset which was a HUGE highlight of this trip. Amazing sunset and just an insane moon like landscape. Had maybe my favorite dinner of the trip at PeMa in Santa Teresa Gallura nearby. 
  - 7th day, tour La Maddalena. Weather was windy as hell so we couldn’t really enjoy the beaches unfortunately. Caprera island was beautiful and I wish I knew i had to reserve the Cala Coticcio hike in advance as it looked so pretty. 
  - 8th day, checked out Porto Cervo which wasn’t my vibe. Not into fake wealthy towns. Totally would skip it. Nearby beaches Spiaggia Principe and Capriccioli were probably the most beautiful beaches in the whole trip from a water color perspective. 

Overall -
Amazing trip. I’ve traveled to 10 other regions of Italy already and this was by far the most unique. It’s more wild, a little rural in regards to less populated areas, and just unique locals. The people were kind and I could tell they cared about the land and ocean a lot from my small conversations. Sardinia is definitely heaven for nature minded folks as the landscapes are so diverse. I felt like I was in multiple ecosystems every day. The mountains, ocean, farmlands, and vast wild terrain is truly a playground for the curious explorer.

ItalyTravel,"Copying someone else's post outlining the first few days of their trip,  but it seemed popular so here's mine:

We're 9 hours behind where I'm from, but fortunately we got in around 9pm and went to sleep around 12, so I think being able to sleep right away,  at night,  helped any jet lag that might've happened.  

Day one,  we had nothing planned except a food tour at night,  so we wandered around and ended up visiting the pantheon. I had tried to purchase tickets beforehand but it didn't go through.  We stood in about a 5 minute lineup to purchase the tickets with cash and got in. (The card payment lineup was longer). 

The food tour through,  Food Tours of Rome, was excellent. Learned interesting history and tasted delicious food. (Apparently the Jewish Ghetto section is one of the best areas for food in Rome, along with Trastavere). 

Day two (Wednesday) was busy, starting with 8am at the Vatican. Since we had tickets we got in fairly quickly (arrived around 7:45), but there were already long lineups for people without tickets. Fortunately, it wasn't that busy inside, even the Sistine Chapel had a lot of space to look around and empty benches to sit.

That afternoon we went on a crypts and catacombs tour which was very neat,  and apparently these are the OG catacombs and the Paris ones are wannabes. (NB, if you like bones,  the Capucin crypt has plenty,  the catacombs,  not so much,  just holes in the walls where bones of early Christians used to be until the visigoths stole them for ransom).

The evening we had dinner at Enzo29, a must! Then a walking ghost tour, wherein we learned that if you want to test your significant other (male) take him to the Sant'Angelo bridge on September 11 and if he sees the ghost of Beatrice Cenci, he is not a keeper.

Day 4: a free day where we explored the city and shops on foot and walked about 40,000+ steps.

Never felt threatened by scammers or had anyone try to steal anything from us (that we were aware of,  but just be vigilant). We were very warm in the sun and didn't bother bringing our coats days 3 and 4. 

Side note, the spritz's (at least the ones we had) are MUCH sweeter than we are used to and they were not enjoyable - but sticking to wine was perfect! Overall, great experience, and I 100% recommend doing at least one or two city tours since you learn so much more than you think you might!

Our itinerary is to fly into Milan, take a train to Venice, after a few days we will rent a car and drive to Florence, trying to stop at Bologna on the way. Then on to Rome in a rental car.

The question is this. We will be spending a few days in Florence. Should we return our rental car in Florence and just take public transit everywhere, or should we keep our rental car for the duration and use to for Rome as well?

We are unsure how well and reliable the public transit is in Florence that would allow us to visit the majority of places or if we are better off with a rental car.

Unfortunately, they also don’t offer translator services.

This leaves us with two tough choices: either pick a central location and drive to visit the cities that mean so much to her or sacrifice her true wish and stay in just one place for the entire 7 days.

It’s heartbreaking to see her struggling with this decision. We would really appreciate any ideas or suggestions that might help find a way to bring her wish to life as closely as possible.

ItalyTravel,"I have been to Rome a couple of times in the last 10 years. I just planned a new trip as a gift to my godson (nephew), this is a belated gift for his 18th birthday.

Now, I know how to do Rome culturally, so I'll show him around the classics: the Colosseum, the Vatican, the Pantheon, the Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain and so on. At night we'll also walk around Trastevere and the Spanish Steps.

But how do I impress my godson with some unique, cool Roman experiences that are more suitable for young adults? So far, I can only think of one thing: going to a football match. I'm having a hard time finding events in September that we can do, like a concert, festival, or anything unique and typically Roman for the cool crowd (which is not me anymore).

My godson isn't naturally inclined towards museums or cultural things like opera, but he has a real open mind and would go to anything just for the experience, he just would not explicitly look for it. Any experiences you've had as a tourist or can recommend to me as a Roman?

We arrive Thursday, the 19th at 15h and leave on Tuesday the 24th at 21h, so we have a lot of time on our hands. I haven't booked anything yet to keep my options open, but I will have to book the Galleria Borghese, Vatican, and Colosseum in advance not long from now.

ItalyTravel,"Like mentioned in my previous post, I got most of my information from the [Girls Love Travel Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/share/jB8jzgU178RheZKh/?mibextid=K35XfP) - didn’t realize this sub existed until a few days before i left for Rome. Here is a culmination of all that help, along with watching a lot of tik toks! One content creator that helped was [Lauren Karwoski](https://www.tiktok.com/@suitelifeoflauren)

Day 1:
- train from Rome to Florence. Very easy to get to and understand where to board / etc. GET THERE VERY EARLY. I had a big suitcase and was an idiot, running to catch the train and had to legit hold 50lbs on my lap the entire 90 minutes. I booked a business seat and it was nice. Recommend. 
- Taxi to [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/slink/cfPohzP0). Very easy to get a taxi. Instead of “FREENOW” which is the big taxi app in Rome, the app here is called “TAXI Move”. €14 and some change to get to my airbnb. Super cozy airbnb with a very responsive host. I can link it if anyone is interested! 
- Coffee at lunetta. More expensive than shops in Rome but honestly really good. Pretty sure it was family run. Son working the counter and grandfather watching the young granddaughter. Such a sweet environment 
- Napoleone for dinner. Good aperol spritz and you get soup and bread (maybe i ordered this and didn’t understand the waiter, lol!). The food was good quality but a bit salty. I’d come back regardless. 

Day 2: 
- Gelateria Letizia - good doppio espresso and croissant. Everything was a bit busier today because of the Tour de France starting in Florence. Didn’t know that was happening until i got here 🫣
- Uffizi gallery - gorgeous museum! It had a lot more information on the paintings than previous museums. I didn’t do any tour and despite that, i felt like i learned a lot. I spent two hours there and only left then because my feet were killing me. Easily could’ve spent another hour there in the 2nd and 3rd levels. 
- Lunch at trattoria la casalinga. You can make a reservation via email. Got the bolognese which was very good. The service is 🤌🏼 the menu in person is all in Italian but the one online is in English. The waiter i had did not speak the best English but we persevered (i said yes to all his questions lol) 
- Brandy is way better here than in Rome!!
- Budellino for drinks. You get little chips and it’s a great snack. €14 for 2 drinks is a steal 
- Ristorante il paiolo. Good quality food and cooking but no flavor. Complimentary lemoncello which is cool. Good espresso. 

Day 3:
- Accademia: got coffee at mangia e bevi which is across from the entrance to academia. It was ok. Didn’t make a reservation for the academia and very much regret it. 2 hour wait in line overall it was a good experience inside. Like the Uffizi, there was a lot of info provided for each piece of art. Very few people came upstairs in comparison to the amount of people on the first level. 
- Panini at ino. Pretty sure this was recommended on tik tok. It was good but the particular one i ordered was dry. Very good quality though. 
- Mancuso for cannoli. Another rec from tik tok. Pretty good! 
- Gelateria santa Maria -  eh ok, had better in Rome. 
- La Scaletta Rooftop Restuarant for Dinner - complimentary wine and other drink (tasted like lime / kale juice). Only sells wine by the bottle which stinks. They do serve cocktails though. Pasta and steak was so were amazing. 

Day 4:
- I did another laundry drop off service. Washed 3 loads of clothes and delivered it to me for €30. You can text the owner as well on WhatsApp. Name of the shop is Wash & Dry Pontassieve. 
- Coffee at caffè Firenze. Coffee was ok. 
- Coffee and croissant at caffè santo spirito. Really good cream croissant. 
- Went to Conad’s by ponte vecchio. Best stocked store ive went to so far and best prices. 
- Lunch at il ristoro dei perditempo. I got a charcuterie board and wine. Good price for the amount of food. 
- A friend joined me in Florence! For dinner we had bolognese and pesto. The service and wait staff were great and they had a good selection of wine.  

Day 5:
- We went on a walking tour of Siena and Pisa with walkabout tours and had a great experience! I can link the tour if anyone is interested. 

Day 6: 
- Had to check out of Airbnb and check into the [monastery](https://www.monasterystays.com/?d=Italy/Tuscany/Florence//TOF104-accommodation) in the same plaza because i messed up the reservation dates. The monastery is Casa Santo Nome di Gesu. This was the largest shower I’ve had so far in Italy. However the AC was questionable. They allowed for early check in which was nice! 
- My friend and i then walked around the duomo. We got some coffee at black bar and it was not great. We weren’t expecting much since it was so close to the duomo but still. 
- We then went and got Affogato at Vivoli. I saw this recommendation on tik tok by Arabella Stokes. It was really good! It was €6 for the affogato. It had a decently long line. Minimal area to sit but two bathrooms and a place to charge your devices. 
- Went shopping at the Leather school and Uashmama, both two Italian focused / owned shops! We bought belts and book marks at the leather school. They had so many items and the smell was great. 
- Lunch at Ristorante Pizzeria Le Antiche Carroze - was ok. The service wasn’t the best. I got the penne all’arrabbiata and my mom got the tagiltalle. This was the first time in about 10-12 days I had something semi spicy which was great. 
- Borgo antico - DO NOT GO. The food was very very mediocre. The wine was good but that was really it. There were also very annoying birds (i know - staff can’t really do anything about this) so just something to note. 

Random thoughts: 
- Feels more expensive than Rome. I talked with someone else on my walkabout tour and they felt similarly. 
- I’m not sure if i was feeling a bit jaded because i was getting tired of traveling alone but i just didn’t enjoy Florence as much as i did Rome. I felt like Rome had a lot of history. Florence obviously had some but Rome took the cake. 
- I was here for Tour de France (not intended whatsoever) so i think that contributed to how busy things felt. 
- In comparison to Florence, the city wasn’t as loud and there wasn’t as much of a police presence! 

Overall, I think 5 days + 1 day trip in Florence is plenty. I spent most of my time on the side of Florence with Palazzo Pitti. I found it to be a bit quieter and more relaxing. If i had more time i think i would do another walkabout tour. I really enjoyed it. It was pretty hot during my time here and either day 3 or 4, i forgot, it was miserable to the point i came back to my airbnb and slept. 

Didn’t get to do:
- Palazzo pitti
- Boboli gardens 

Things i walked by that looked cute:
- Il Santino 
- Gold and Florence via tamberseca 
- Cafe Odeon 
- Coexist
- La giostra - recommended on tik tok 
- Trattoria zaza - recommended on tik tok 
- Alla vecchia bettola 
- Hotel lungaro
- Bella fiorina

ItalyTravel,"Not an issue with the taxi apps themselves, but taxi drivers cancel the ride when you get on and charge you more. They arrive later than reported time too. 

I used FREENOW and got ripped off in Rome after waiting for the bus that did not arrive. The driver cancelled the ride when we got on and ripped us off in cash. Buses are bad with their ETA too. I feel ripped off for bus tickets too because I haven't been able to use their value.


Edit: thank you all for your suggestions. I did use the report form, though it took a while to be able to report. Because under "" I was charged more than the fare"" I couldn't press the submit button. So I went with the ""I paid with app and cash option/double charge"" option to report. The problem with reporting is I only got his phone number (thankfully, I had it saved from call logs) and I can't see the cancelled ride history in the app so I'm not sure how long it will take for them to search for the driver via number. And I also feel like it's easy to change numbers and register for the app as a driver again.

ItalyTravel,"I plan on taking my gf on a short trip to Spain and Italy.

Right now I'm crossed on whether to do Venice or Florence. I am already doing Rome.

From my own experience, Venice is cool but more like a 2 day thing. Based on my scheduling, I'll be there for 3.5 days. I don't remember much about Florence honestly as I went there as a child, but have had relatives say it is the better option.

I'm leaning towards Florence but am feeling that's just bias from my own personal experience. Feel Venice would be better for my gf since she has never been outside the US before and Venice has this allure to it for first-time travellers to Europe / Italy.

Downside to Venice is that it will require an additional flight since it's so far away from Rome. Downside to Florence is no good flights out of it, so would have to go back to Rome via train (short train ride though) if I want to fly back out to Barcelona.

ItalyTravel,"And so it ends. Our trip was fantastic! Venice was the last stop and it almost nudged Paris out of the top spot for my favourite city, but not quite since it was pouring the whole time we were there. 

The rain didn't stop us from exploring and, with umbrellas, we enjoyed wandering around. The scent of sewage and ocean invaded our senses frequently, but, dare I say, we eventually got used to it? If you're sensitive to smells, be aware. 

We stayed in Gheto Nuovo, which, while it may not look very central on a map, it was easy enough to reach main areas by foot. As a note, something I learned from our food tour in Rome, there are little gold plaques on the ground (all across Europe) indicating the names and death dates of Jewish people in front of where they lived before they were murdered/taken in the Holocaust. A very solemn reminder during an otherwise remarkable trip. 

We planned a day trip to Murano, getting on the Vaporetto was easy and while we purchased tickets, they were never checked. Also, if you forget to buy tickets, you can alert the crew when you board and they'll sell you a ticket. It took us about 20 minutes to walk from Gheto Nuovo to the Fondamente Novo, where the journey to Murano is one stop away and about a 9 minute ride. You can also get on at other stations around Venice but it will take longer than 9 minutes.

As it was pouring with rain on Murano, we only looked in about 15 glass shops then headed back to Venice - there are MANY more. If you have time, it's worth the visit. 

If you like chocolate, the ladies at a chocolate shop (for the life of me I cannot remember the name - but it's along Rio Terà Lista de Spagna and has a gold bar chocolate fountain in the window) will feed you many delicious samples! 

We had pizza dinner one night at Osteria Leone Alato, which was delicious, along with the house Prosecco. 

I also recommend Terafirma café, Torrrefazione Cannareggio, and Amo, located in a T Fondaco del Tedeschi, for the absolutely delicious drink of the same name (like a Hugo but not as sweet), even the frozen (and partly thawed Tiramisu was good). 

Fortunately, we were granted a reprieve from the rain on our last night and we walked the seawall area to the east and enjoyed wine along the canal at Dodo. 

We took a water taxi to VCE, which was 135 Euros and worth it! We booked it online the day before through Consorzio Motoscafi Venezia.

ItalyTravel,"Hello! I am currently looking at booking my Vatican tickets through the official website for my trip in February. There is a guided tour at 10am, and most of the day is open for individual tickets (starting at 8am but the earliest I’ll be able to get there is 9am). Reading mixed reviews on the guides. Some say it’s a must, some say the crowds are so overwhelming you can’t even hear your guide. I’m sure it’s going to be packed but I’m hoping February will be a little better than usual. Thoughts?

Edit: thanks for the advice everyone! A lot of people suggested doing the early morning small tour but unfortunately it’s not in the budget. It’s probably going to be busy any time of day!

ItalyTravel,"My husband, toddler and I are heading to Italy to visit my mom who is living there for a couple years.  We're leaving in a few days.  It's not the greatest timing in the world for a trip, but due to some other things, it was kind of now or never, and we didn't want to pass up visiting family while also getting to go to Italy with (primarily) free lodging.  We're going to mostly be in Naples, but will also be taking some side trips to both Rome and Florence.  All our lodging is booked, and everything seemed good to go!  Well, in the last month, we've unexpectedly had several, very large expenses come up at the worst possible time.  So we're now realizing that we're going to have to be very cautious with our spending while we're there.  I'm feeling extremely disappointed and frustrated that I'll have to penny pinch instead of feeling at least a bit relaxed to buy and try what I'd like to.  I'm thinking in terms of food and drink, but we also cancelled the day tour from Florence that we had planned and I'm pulling the plug on the cooking class that my mom and I were going to do. (Btw, we're very frugal in general, I was never planning to go wild with spending.) I know we'll still have a lovely time and we're still extremely privileged to be able to go at all.  I just need to reframe my expectations a bit.  Has anyone been to Naples, Rome, Florence under similar circumstances?  Does anyone have any Italian-travel-on-a-budget tips?  Taking the speed train to our various destinations alone is going to cost us a little more than $500.  I wasn't expecting that to be so expensive, which was my lack of planning.

ItalyTravel,"Good morning every one, I just wanted to take a moment to reminisce on my once-in-a-lifetime trip to Italy in August. We traveled to 5 different cities, had 3 plane rides, 3 train rides, and endless inspiration, awe, and fun.

There is some context to this trip, skip this part for the actual report: my girlfriend, her mom, her aunt and her cousins are big Swifties. They love themselves some Taylor. So, a year and a half ago her mom (who is literally executive level at linkdin. She travels A TON) secured tickets to Taylor’s show in Vienna— the one that got unfortunately cancelled to terror threats (which was a heartbreak for them surely. Gfs still really not over it.) they secured the tickets and, as rich folk do, decided to plan a whole family vacation in Italy around it. You bet your ass I wanted to come so I started saving money. Paid for all my own airplane tickets, hotel rooms and airBnBs. Big key is that I only had to pay for myself, NOT my gf. Phew. On to the trip.

So, our flight was on the 31st of July. We flew out of JfK in NYC. Landed in Amsterdam at, like, 5 AM local time for a whopping 7 hour layover. At some point between Amsterdam and NYC, my gfs mom lost her wallet. Not her phone and passport fortunately, but it was a fire drill. It is still lost to this day, not sure what happened. After our 7 hour layover, we boarded a flight to our first stop: Catania, Sicily. 

We landed in Catania and went straight to the hotel, straight to our hotel rooms, straight to the showers… it had been a long day: 7 hour flight to Amsterdam, 7 hour layover, 3 hour flight to Catania. After a brief fresh up, we hit the beach at the foot of our hotel. Now, I say beach… it was more like the end of the island. There really wasn’t sand. Just a dock with stairs that go into the water. I opted not to swim— I’m not much of a swimmer. I can swim, I just did copious amounts of swimming when I was young so nowadays… I’m over it. But we lounged about a bit, went back to the rooms and picked some nicer outfits and went to a restaurant nearby for some pizza by the coast line. Not sure what was better: the vibes of a sunset by the coast of Sicily or the pizza.

Next day, we were off to Milazzo. We also met up with the other half of my gfs family. In total, there was 11 of us. My gfs uncle, believe it or not, is a nuclear engineer with the US navy and was stationed in Naples for a number of years. Through his military contacts, we rented out a Mercedes sprinter and a Peugeot SUV to drive from Catania to Milazzo. While on our way, there was a YUGE accident and we were stuck in a standstill on the highway for about 2 1/2 hours. Sort of an experience in and of itself. Anyways, we got through and made our way to Milazzo.

My gfs family actually has some family who live locally on Sicily in a small town called Mazzara Sant Andrea so after checking into our Hotel in Milazzo and dropping off our travel stuff, we headed out to see the family. Mazzara is a small town with really tight roads. Navigating it in a sprinter van and SUV proved to be pretty tough. Plenty of natives sitting on the front of their porch judging the hell out of us, likely wondering what the hell these stupid Americans were doing there. Anyways, we found parking, wandered around the town a little bit when my gfs family in Sicily found us and guided us back to their house. lol! 

We had an extremely late lunch— which was ultimately dinner for us stupid Americans. It was fantastic. Some pasta, meats and cheeses, breads, etc. after lunch, the family took us to a locals beach and we watched the sunset and swam in the Mediterranean and it was positively magical. The sunset was positively unbelievable. The church of the black Madonna sat on a mountain along the coastline and just added to the whole vibe… absolutely beautiful.

Next day, we woke up in our hotels in Milazzo. We were going to meet up with the family again but we had some time in the morning so we checked out the Castillo di Milazzo. Very cool! Plenty of great spots to observe the peasants. After that, we met back up with the family in Mazzara. There, they took us up to the church of the black Madonna. Beautiful, historic church. Definitely worth the stop and I’m glad we went. We tried checking out the Greek theater but there was a show that they were preparing for that night so they wouldn’t let us in. Anyways, we headed back to the families place and had a proper Italian-Sicilian dinner. Some Cabrito on the charcoal grill, some arancini, the usual meats/cheeses/breads… all absolutely divine. The family took us out that night and we went to a bar. Me and my gf actually didn’t stick around long for this and ended up heading back to the hotel room around 10:30 local time. 

The next morning, we were off for our first train ride. We were riding from Milazzo to Salerno, which is on the mainland. How do you ride a train over the ocean, you may ask? Easy! Simply load the train on a boat, ship it over, and ride from the rest of the way. Super cool. There were train tracks on the boat so the trains just ride up, on to the boat. Doors shut behind and you’re on your way. When you’re on the boat, they allow you to get out and roam around and enjoy the views. 

Salerno was a cool, hip city. We landed, got off the train, checked into our hotel room around 3 pm local time. Most of the crew opted for showers/ a nap. Since me and my gf had an early night, we still had some fuel so we decided to hit the streets with some of her younger cousins. It was fun! We were able to explore the area, stumbled upon an ancient church and aqueduct. Got some souvenirs. Grabbed some bottles of lemoncello for my dad per his request. 

Most of the family planned dinner at some seafood place. Alas, I have a shellfish allergy and just tend to stay away from seafood altogether so me and my gf found a nice steakhouse to go to and boy oh boy… one of the best steaks I’ve ever had. It was cool because next to the chefs pass there was what looked like a deli with all the meat cuts there so you could literally go over, shop your cut, and watch as they slice it up and grill it right there. They deliver the steak rare and give you a hot stone to cook it as you see fit. Positively unreal.

The next day was an early and long day. We were off to Pompeii. Hit the train and arrived maybe 10:30-11 AM local time. Hopped on a bus and headed up Vesuvius. I’m in my late 20s so, still pretty young. My gfs cousins are all mostly teenagers or in their very early 20s. I was impressed that I kept right up with all of them and we hiked right up to the top while my gf and most of the older folks in our party fell behind. The view was incredible! Then, we hit the ruins which was pretty tough. Italy in August is HOT. There is no real shade in Pompeii. Some of us tapped out here. Not me! We were able to catch *some* of the tour and it was impressive… you don’t realize how big the Pompeii ruins are, there is a lot there and a lot to see. We saw probably 1/3rd of it but had to go catch a train to Rome.

Got to Rome later that day. Checked into our Airbnb, grabbed a quick bite somewhere local and went to bed. Next morning was the colosseum. 

The colosseum was pretty awesome. We took a tour which made the experience that much more interesting and engaging. Our tour guide was great! By the end of it, I wanted to be his friend. Caught the Roman forum in the same tour, too. The rest of that day was mostly dedicated to doing whatever we wanted. Some of us went shopping, some of us went to the pantheon. Me and my gf went back to the Airbnb, took a nap and a shower and got ready for dinner which ended up at another steak house. It was delicious again. That night, me and some of my gfs cousins rented out some Lime electric scooters and whipped around Rome at night and that was an absolute blast. Shout out to the Lime app— easily the best way to get around the city. 

The following day was our trip to the Vatican. The Vatican was absolutely intoxicating… there is so much art and history, it really tugs on your heart strings. It’s really difficult to capture and see all of the Vatican in one day but we got a great tour guide to bring us around. St. Peter’s basilica was absolutely wild. 

We had 2 more days in Rome/Italy. The rest of that was spent doing all manner of stuff— plenty of eating, shopping, stomping around the historic sites, whipping around on electric scooters. Such fun. my gf, her mom, her aunt and a cousin split from me and the rest of our group to board their flights to Vienna were they got the news that the T Swift show was cancelled which, as I said, was a gut punch for them. I was able to make it home on a 9 hour, one way flight that was over all pretty smooth. This trip was absolutely incredible and it was everything I thought it was going to be, and more. It was absolutely magical and truly felt like it was once-in-a-lifetime for me. ",t2_j2sj3gt2,My Once-In-a-Lifetime Trip in August ,0.77,14,1729947515.0,1729947515.0,11,BananramaClamcrotch,1gckik2
ItalyTravel,"I just returned from a trip starting in Rome before visiting Florence, Naples, and Ischia. These are subjective observations based on my experience. Hopefully, they can be of some use to future travelers.

* In Rome and Florence, taxis were very difficult to hail or book ahead of time, regardless of means - busy corner, taxi stand, app, etc. Our hotel was twice unsuccessful in calling one to pick us up. 
* In Naples, not a single taxi would agree to charging a legitimate metered fare, with a 5-7 minute ride ranging anywhere from 25 to 50 Euros.
* Uber Black cost us more than a legitimate taxi fare but was relatively more (not always) reliable for a pick-up.
* Although some people are fine using only a credit card, it is useful to take a debit card along and withdraw some cash from a bank-affiliated ATM to...facilitate certain transactions.
* For all the talk of public pay restrooms, I encountered one on my entire journey. It was located at the bottom of Roma Termini and accepted credit card payment.
* When buying a single destination train ticket, check to see if there is a connection change. And ensure that the set of tickets included in your journey allow enough time to make that connection.
* Depend on arrival/departure display boards for information about delays, and do not expect any proactive notifications about a delayed train arrival (PA announcement, email, push notification, etc.).
* Renting and driving a car was perfectly fine. If it's an electric vehicle, take some time to scout out charging stations along your route that are compatible with the fobs provided by your rental agency.
* If you don't have a Telepass, tolls can be paid by obtaining at ticket at the toll road entrance and paying by credit card upon exiting at a ""CARTE"" designated gate.
* When driving, it would help to preview your planned routes with satellite view to make sure your navigation app is not directing you to take very narrow alleyways or even biking/walking trails on which cars are prohibited to travel.
* We used both Vodafone and Airalo data-only e-sims during the trip, and Airalo had far superior coverage and reception at every location we visited.
* I know there are free options, but buying Skype credits to enable us to call local phone numbers (restaurants, concierge desk, etc.) was easy and very useful.

The underground fully guided tour had open slots for at least 2-4 minutes. I frustratingly had trouble getting my ticket to the checkout while the timer counted down (some glitch), but I was able to grab another phone and get a ticket still and successfully checked out. 

The underground fully guided experience drops at a different time than the non-guided (which is 8:45am Rome time). I was able to snag the 9:30am tour time which was 12:30am here on the U.S. west coast for the date I needed 30 days (I think) prior. 

So I’d say don’t just totally give up on being able to snag those tickets. Have a couple computers/phones ready to refresh at 9:30am Rome time for the full tour and the odds may be in your favor.

ItalyTravel,"**Florence Frequently Asked Questions**     
  

Hello lovely people of Reddit! 

For the past few years of my Reddit life, I have seen that many questions regarding aspects of Florence get repeated periodically in this sub (and in a couple others), so I’ve decided to try and make a series of *FFAQs [Florence Frequently Asked Questions]* posts, hoping to help anyone who might be searching for useful information on our beautiful city. 
This is the first post of my project, and it’s about **public transport**, hopefully if it is appreciated I will be doing more in the near future. 

I hope you will find it useful!

#**PUBLIC TRANSPORT**    
(latest update: September2024)

##*Tramvia:*  
  
Florence is slowly building a tram network. The tram is a sort of urban mini-train, with dedicated tracks, which make it a fast, reliable and cheap way to get from one side to the other of the city. At the moment Florence has two tram lines, T1 and T2, but is currently designing lines T3 and T4.   
- Line T1 connects Careggi (main hospital) to Scandicci, cutting through the city in the North-South direction; 
- Line T2 connects piazza dell’Unità (City center) with Peretola (AIRPORT).  
The two lines both also stop at Santa Maria Novella TRAIN STATION.  
The frequency of trams is (during a normal day) of about one tram every 4-5 minutes. For weekends, holidays, early morning or late evening the frequency is lower. A detailed overview can be found [here](https://www.gestramvia.it/timetables/?lang=en), where there are also indicated the times of the first and last runs of the day. 

Tickets cost 1.70€, must be acquired before getting on the tram, and can be bought (cash or card) at the machines present at each stop, via app (“AT bus”), or at any “Tabaccheria” shop in Florence. Both paper tickets and digital tickets MUST BE ACTIVATED/VALIDATED when  boarding, and last 90 minutes from the time of activation. (To validate paper tickets you must insert them in the yellow machines that you can find inside the tram, next to each door, while digital tickets will need to be activated directly in the app).  
Ticket controllers are found frequently (although not present in every tram), and they WILL FINE YOU if you haven’t validated your ticket (and, obviously, if you don’t have a ticket). They are very strict and there is no space for negotiation. 
  
  
##Contactless Ticketing (valid both for Tram and Bus):    
 
Starting from March 7th 2024, in Trams and Buses there is also be the possibility to use your credit card (or equivalent digital twin on your smart device) to pay for the ticket directly on board, with a contactless “TAP ON” (and tap off for extra-urban buses) system.    
  
It is important to remember that:  
- Each credit card (or equivalent digital twin) allows you to buy only one ticket. There is no point in trying to tap the same card more than once because it will register only one ticket.  
- You must tap your card each time you get on a tram or bus, so if you get off the tram and get on a bus you must tap the card again (as long as 90mins haven’t passed, in this case you won’t be charged an extra 1.70€).   
- You must tap your card when you get off the bus ONLY on extra-urban rides - the ones that take you out of the city.    
  
While il might be confusing, the reason is the following:  
  
for urban rides, the fare is fixed (1.70€), and each ticket has a time duration of 90mins;   
  
for extra urban rides, the fare depends on the distance of your ride, so you need to “tap off” to determine how much you will be charged on your card. (If on extra urban rides you don’t tap off, you will be charged as if you had travelled to the final destination of the line).
  

More details can be found [HERE](https://www.at-bus.it/en/tiptap).
   

##*Bus:*  
  
The bus company in Florence is Autolinee Toscane (AT), and it is the same one that manages the tramvia ticketing. AT took over Florence’s historical bus company (ataf) not long ago, and is therefore still suffering from many problematic issues. While the bus routes tend to cover most of the city, it is very difficult to be up to date with every line, since the new bus service is still not particular efficient and also Florence roads are currently full of street works (mainly due to the construction of the new tram lines), so bus routes can change from one day to the other. 
  
The ticket system is similar to that of the tram with the sole difference that there are no automatic ticket machines at bus stops. Usually tickets are bought at “Tabaccherie” or via app. They can also be bought on the bus, directly from the driver(for a slightly higher price of 2.00€ instead of 1.70€) but often drivers will not have any tickets left, so it’s always best to buy them before hand. Just like for the tram, tickets must be validated as soon as you board the bus.   
  
At a bus stop, on the arrival of the bus, you should make it clear to the driver that you want to board (and are not, for example, waiting for another bus number). A slight hand gesture is the standard signal. Once on the bus, remember to keep an eye on where you are (maybe using Google maps), and remember to book your stop by pressing one of the red buttons, when yours is the next. Buses will not automatically stop everywhere, and will skip stops if nobody is waiting at them and if nobody has booked the stop. 

Routes and (approximate) timetables can be found on the [official website](https://www.at-bus.it/en).

 
##*Taxi:*   
  
There are two main taxi companies in Florence, and their names are, for simplicity, the same as their phone number:

- (+39) 055 4242   
- (+39) 055 4390

To book a taxi you can call their number, tell the operator the location you want to be picked up at (or schedule for a specific time and place). and inform them if you have any special/specific needs (stroller, large luggage, wheelchair, etc). You will then wait for the operator to find an available taxi and then you will be told the name of the taxi (the standard names are “Italian city + number”, so for example you could have CATANIA 23, or MILANO 5, etc) and the waiting time.  Only when the taxi arrives you will tell the driver your desired destination.   
  
You can also book a taxi via the app “appTaxi”, with which you can also fin out the approximate price of the journey you need.    
  
You can also find taxis parked in some of the main squares in the city center (ex. Station, Piazza Repubblica, Piazza Santa Croce, etc). In that case ask the driver of the first taxi of the line “è libero?” (“Is it available?”). Make sure to check that the taxi will take card payment if you don’t have cash.  
  
PLEASE NOTE: whilst in some classic films you see people signalling to stop any passing by taxi, this will not work in Florence (nor in the rest of Italy, from what I know), and no taxi will stop and pick you up like that.

##*Uber:*   
 
Works in Florence only as “Uber Black”, whereby only people with a specific NCC license can register as drivers for Uber. I personally have no experience with the service, but have heard that it works quite well. 

##*Car Sharing:* 
At the moment there are two private companies renting out their cars for single journeys, and they are:  
- Enjoy; 
- TiMove;  
To use them you have to register to their website/app and connect a payment method. Once registered you can use the map to find the nearest car.  
  
##*Electric scooter:*   
Just like car sharing, the city is filled with electric scooters laying almost everywhere. The main companies they belong to are:   
 
- Bird;  
- BitMobility; 
- RideMovi.

If there’s a wait, how does that interaction normally go and what’s the polite way to say “no thank you we don’t want to wait that long”? Are to-go boxes a thing and how do you ask for one? Uh oh, something in the order is wrong, how do we politely convey that?Really, any unusual things that could happen when dining. 

What about in a taxi or train station? Any dialogue or things to listen for that would be beneficial to know? 

Polite and casual way to apologize for my poor Italian? (lol)

God forbid, if there’s a medical emergency happening, what’s the best way to ask for help or express urgency of a situation? 

Not sure if this would get you laughed at but are there any ways to tell a scammer to back off/stop, in Italian, if they are being persistent?

Thanks in advice for all the helpful info and comments that already exists on this sub. I am in my mid 30s and lost my husband earlier this year.

* Florence Feb 28-March 4 
* Lucca (with 1 day trip to Pisa) March March 4-7 
* Rome (with day trip to Pompeii) March 7-13th

I'm wondering if I should include a couple of days in Naples, I haven't bought my flight out of Rome yet so I can extend for a couple days if needed. Maybe go from Lucca to Naples/Pompeii for a couple days then head to Rome?

ItalyTravel,"Just back from a 12 day trip to Amalfi Coast, Capri and Rome. Been watching this sub for awhile and thanks to all on here for tips before our trip, they were extremely helpful and wanted to pay it forward with a trip report. Not one bad thing to report. 

We went to London for two days on the way there from USA and then flew into Naples from London with private transfer to La Barbera in Praiano. Highly recommend La Barbera. We loved having Praiano as a home base. So quiet (almost too quiet) at night with good restaurants in town (km0, Che Bonta and Kasai twice). The older man who runs Kasai is such a sweet and genuine person who talked to us for awhile both times and remembered me the second evening. 

Went to Ravello the first day via water taxi from Marina de Praia to Amalfi and then the Amico Shuttle up to Ravello. Can't recommend both enough. We didn't want to mess with the SITA buses and glad we did not based upon what we saw. The water taxi was a little pricey (85 euro round trip) but likely cheaper in the long run versus various cabs to get to Ravello and a much better experience on the water. Amico Shuttle was seamless and 15 euro round trip. We watched various arguments over SITA bus access and leaving people behind while leaving from both Amalfi and Ravello so we were glad we did Amico. Bought tickets the day before online. Ravello was amazing and might be the best place we visited. So peaceful compared to the other towns. We walked around town and visited both villas, which were beautiful. Had an amazing lunch at Mimi's, highly recommend. We went back down and cruised through Amalfi and Atrani. Liked Atrani a lot but Amalfi, not so much. So crowded and full of tourist shops. The cathedral was beautiful, however. We went to the Beach Bar in Amalfi before our water taxi back to Praiano and that was a nice respite from the crowds. 

Next day we went on a whole day Amalfi Coast group boat tour with Plaghia Charters and had a great experience. There were about 12 people on boat on a larger boat and they picked up and dropped off in Praiano from your accommodation.  Had a great lunch at La Tonnarella in Conca dei Marini. Might be best baby calamari we've ever had. Others went to Amalfi for a few hours but glad we did the lunch and beach. So pretty. 

The next day we had a little rain in the morning and went to Positano about 11 via the Mobility Amalfi Coast bus from Praiano. Walked about 5 mins to bus stop and we were 3rd and 4th people on the bus which filled up on the way but not too crazy. Positano was breathtaking in person and had a great afternoon walking around town and lunch at Lo Guarricino, which was so so but beautiful view. I would say Positano was moderately crowded but never felt uncomfortable and luckily temps last week were about 75. Great experience. For the bus coming back, I would say to get on Piazza dei Mulini as it filled up there and we didn't even stop at Sponda on the way out of town to Praiano. It was pouring after we got on so got pretty lucky there. 

Next day we transferred over to Anacapri via a water taxi and ferry. Water taxi was extremely helpful as we were running late for ferry but ended up making it easily as ferry was about 20 minutes late. We stayed up at Da Gelsomina in Anacapri and loved it. Rooms were simple but great views and a pool and an amazing restaurant. Shuttle to Anacapri as well anytime. We loved the town of Anacapri compared to Capri Town as it was much less crowded and more easily walkable. Did the chair lift which was great. 

Next day we did a 3 hour private boat tour with Gianni's Boats which I would highly recommend. You need to see Capri from the water. Swam around a bit as well. We skipped Blue Grotto. Shopped around Capri and went to Panorama for lunch, highly recommend. Great view and food. Recommended by Gianni's guy and he called for us and got a great table with a view. 

Next day midmorning we then transferred from Anacapri to Rome via ferry and fast train. Our first NLG ferry was cancelled and they didn't really explain why but got on the Superjet no problem 40 mins later. Super smooth ride and water was rough. Was surprised. I had booked non-changeable train ticket but we made it in time, even with pizza at Fresco in Naples train station, which was really good. Train was going 298 km/d at one point which was fun and love train travel in Europe. So relaxing. 

Got into Rome at Termini and took a taxi to our Airbnb in Jewish Ghetto. Great location but a little loud at night with the restaurants downstairs. Walks to sights were 10-15 mins usually. I would say there was definitely some construction in Rome but did not hamper our experience  at all other than Piazza Navona. All three fountains are being worked on and just kind of took the air out of what would be a beautiful area. Went to Armando al Pantheon that evening and had an outside table.  The amatriciana was pretty good but the caprese appetizer thought was amazing with the breadcrumbs included. Something different. Kind of expected a little more with all of the hype. 

Did a Colosseum tour the next morning with The Tour Guy, which I would recommend. Amazing to see in person. That whole road leading up to it was pedestrian only on Sundays and just beautiful to walk around and see everything. Many people playing music. Got some pizza afterwards and not sure we love Roman pizza compared to the stuff we had in Southern Italy. Did some shopping and more walking and did aperitivo in Campo di Fiori, which is beautiful. Went to Riscioli for dinner and hands down, best meal we had. Meat & cheese, cacio e pepe, carbonara, wine, everything. 

The next day we visited the Vatican which was extremely crowded. St. Peter's, was amazing but I think one visit is enough. Went to Pantheon and Spanish Steps this day too and then did some shopping. Ended up in Trastevere for the late afternoon/evening. Great to just walk around and have aperitivo and then dinner at Cecelia Santa Cucina which I cannot recommend enough. Just did regular menu.

All in all an amazing trip. First time for both of us and we will definitely be back but want to see other regions. A few thoughts...

- We didn't see any crime in Rome and saw no pickpocketing. We heard some stories about pickpocketing on the Metro but that was it. There were a few bracelet guys at the Colosseum and Spanish Steps. I never once felt unsafe at all in Italy. 

- We walked everywhere in Rome other than a cab with our bags, it is the best way to do it. 15 to 18k steps a day. Just get lost and find amazing things.

- Go sit and have aperitivo. Those were some of the best parts of our trip just sitting and watching people go by and talking. 

- Late September wasn't too crowded anywhere we went. Other than the Vatican, I felt like it was definitely manageable. 

- Go to Ravello. I didn't think I'd like Capri but loved parts of Capri Town and all of Anacapri.

- We added a $300 to the budget for transportation on the coast and in Capri and found that this was 100% worth it. We did the easier Mobility bus and Amico but otherwise utilized Water Taxi on the coast and mostly taxis in Capri and so much less wasted time and ease. If you can do it, it is worth it.

- Gianni's Boat in Capri was worth the money to do a private tour around the island. One of the best parts of our trip. Any time you can take a boat instead of a vehicle, do it. 

- Don't pack in an plan your whole day, leave some time to just walk and explore. In Rome you'll just stumble upon beautiful churches, buildings, etc.

ItalyTravel,"Ciao!

My girlfriend and I are visiting Bologna for our anniversary, and I want to make the weekend extra special by taking her on a f(good )tour around the city. She’s a huge foodie, so I’m looking for those hidden gems—restaurants, trattorias, or street food spots that truly capture the essence of Bologna. We love exploring local flavors and authentic experiences, so anything off the beaten path or especially beloved by locals is exactly what I’m after!

Beyond food, I’d love to hear about any must-see spots or unique corners of the city that could make the day even more memorable. Whether it’s a piazza, a stunning viewpoint, or a tucked-away art gallery.

Any suggestions are much appreciated—thank you so much in advance for helping make our anniversary unforgettable! 😊

ItalyTravel,"Hello everyone. This is my first post to this subreddit. 

I’m from Lithuania, working fulltime.

I've passion for Italy for some time now. I've been to Italy several times. I like the culture, history, nature, language, people, food, weather and a lot more about this country. I think it's most beautiful country in the world. And I consume lots of information about Italy. 

One day, I got an idea - **to visit all the provinces of Italy**. Yes, visit all 107 provinces of all the 20 regions of Italy. 

I tried to search some information online about this kind of trip. But could find any. Not on YouTube, not on google, not on reddit. Nothing gives the guide, o blog, o experience of such a trip. Or it's bad search engine results, but I couldn’t find info.

So, I'm thinking. Is it possible to do it? I like travel. My wife would travel with me :). I could plan to do it. 

My question is, would it be interesting for others, to view this kind of trip, vloging style? What should I cover? How long I should stay in each province? Should I try local food in all the provinces or just regions? Should I interact with locals? Etc..

Should it be done in one go, let’s say few months, or, in several attempts, in the few years’ time?

Other aspect bothers me, transportation.

Would it be possible to do it in camper van? I suppose that Dolomites and all the northern regions would be difficult, and in some places would be difficult to drive with the van. So, other option, would be by own car. But it adds complexity for accommodations, and base spots for each region. Also, I would prefer to fly to Sardinia but would need a car there.

As I think more, I see, that it's more complex questions, would need to answer. And preparation for such trip could take a year. 

The process of finding information, doing homework for the trip is fun for me. 

What do you think? 

May be I’m missing something? Maybe you could share some thoughts and experiences? 

Any feedback would be welcome.",t2_135dm7,Travel to all Italy provinces,0.88,12,1724353176.0,1724353176.0,13,edvva,1eyrizk

ItalyTravel,"Yesterday I hiked Path of the Gods and it was incredible! After reading accounts about the SITA bus being unreliable and not letting tourists on because it’s full, I had concerns about coming from Salerno. So hopefully this report (as of August 2024) helps folks who want to plan a day trip to the Amalfi Coast from Salerno that involves hiking Path of Gods and visiting Positano. 

Step 1: take Sita Sud 5120 from Salerno to Amalfi

To avoid crowds, we wanted to set out early. So we bought tickets the night before from the tabacchi at the Salerno train station. The bus stop closest to our Airbnb was at Teatro Verdi. The bus was scheduled for 6:03am and it arrived at 6:10am. The bus was less than half full until we reached Maiori. After a couple of stops there the bus became standing room only. After about an hour of windy coastline, we reached the main stop in Amalfi. Worth noting is we considered taking the ferry to Amalfi; however the earliest ferry was at 7:50am, so we wouldn’t have been able to start hiking by our goal time of 9am. 

Step 2: take Sita Sud 5080 from Amalfi to Bomerano

The tabacchi in Salerno told us we needed to buy tickets for the second bus in Amalfi. The tabacchi closest to the Amalfi bus stop was closed when we arrived, but fortunately we noticed a SITA worker near the Amalfi stop selling tickets. After buying tickets, we were able to immediately hop onto a bus that departed at 7:15am for Bomerano. We didn’t see this bus scheduled on Google Maps but were happy to be on our way much earlier than anticipated. 

Step 3: make way to trailhead

We got off the bus at Bomerano just before 8am and started walking toward the trailhead. At this point cafes and bakeries and convenience stores were open. We decided to stop at Chéri Café Agerola where my partner said he had the best espresso of his life (lol). We continued on to the trailhead and made it there at 8:30am.

Step 4: hike to Nocelle

It took us 2 hours to make it to the “lemon point” which is a stand in Nocelle where you can buy lemon slushes. This is the last point before you start descending the stairs to Positano and there are bathrooms. About 80% of the time, we had the path to ourselves. We made several stops along the trail to take plenty of pictures and enjoy the views. I worried the hike would be more crowded but that wasn’t our experience. 

Step 5: descend to Positano and enjoy the town

It took us about 35 minutes to get down all the steps and we were super sweaty by the end. After the steps you still have to walk down a road to get to the main town. Once in the main town, we spent a few hours walking around the town, having lunch, and shopping for souvenirs. We returned to Salerno on a 5pm ferry.

Overall, taking a day trip to the Amalfi coast from Salerno and hiking to Positano was so worth it. Tbh I think Positano is just okay… It’s cute but ultra touristy and pricey, and I don’t care for rocky beaches. So for me, this was the perfect day trip and one of the highlights of my time in Italy.

ItalyTravel,"After two weeks on the Alta Via 2 in the Dolomites, my husband and I decided to spend the third week of our Italian honeymoon in Torino. We initially made this decision for the proximity to the wineries in the Piedmont region. We had reservations at several vineyards in Barbaresco and La Morra and rented a car for the week to navigate, however, we failed to secure an international driver permit in time and could not rent a vehicle. This forced us to spend the whole week in the city proper - we wound up having an absolute blast and ate some of the best meals along the way. We stayed at Hotel Bologna across for the Porto Nuova train station - excellent centralized location in the heart of this very walkable city. For anyone considering a trip to Torino, here were some of our favorite restaurants, wine bars, and attractions:

Restaurants
-Osteria Rabezzana
-Mille
-Razzo (our favorite meal of the trip!)
-UAO Pizza
-Daje
-Scannabue
-Vintage 1997 (our first Michelin starred restaurant - don’t make our rookie mistake by wearing shorts inside 😇)
-Dual Pizzeria 
-Open Baladin
-Aldo’s Bakery (great happy hour focaccia)
-La Piola (in Alba, part of a day trip)

Wine Bars:
-Enoteca Vinile
-Roberto Sarotto (in Alba; we took the train for a day trip)
-Banca del Vino (just outside of Bra - also part of day trip; insanely cool experience)

Activities:
-Shopping - we loved shopping at the men’s boutiques in town, especially Hangover, Tom Thumb and Fresh. We also found good stuff at the Rinascente department store and Falconeri. 
-Walking along the Po River
-Museo Naziole del Cinema at the Mole (be sure to also buy a ticket to ride to the top for the views) 
-Villa della Regna 

If you like to eat, drink, shop, and wander city streets, Torino is a fantastic option! We’re heading to the Amalfi coast now for our final week in Italy. Ciao!

ItalyTravel,"I just booked a last-minute trip to Rome/Tuscany in early June (less than 5 weeks away) which is extremely exciting as I’ve never been to Italy, but a bit daunting with the short amount of time to research/prepare.

I’m American, but I speak Spanish fluently, and it has really helped me in my global travels. I do plan to learn as much beginner Italian as I can before the trip and will utilize it to the best of my abilities, but I wonder if defaulting to Spanish rather than English when my minimal Italian fails me would be beneficial? Or would this be somehow offensive? I really have no idea, and I hope this isn’t a silly question.

For example before I went to Paris last year, I had about two months to learn some beginner French and found it extremely helpful (the Parisians appreciated me trying), but I don’t have that much time unfortunately. I sense how similar Italian and Spanish are (I can grasp concepts when hearing/reading Italian) so I wonder if that would serve me better in situations where people don’t speak much English (and I never want to be THAT American assuming everyone speaks English).

Does anyone have any thoughts or similar experience? Thanks so much!!

I’m from a city near Neaples, and our school decided to give us a project in which we have to develop a statistical report on a topic of our choice, me and my group decided to choose “tourism” as a topic.

So, to whoever replies to this post, I’m very thankful for your help,

I was really sad to see the Thello lines were discontinued as a result of Covid, but this looks promising.

This is a really fun way to travel—waking up in another country, seeing the different landscape, seeing town signs flash by and trying to look them up to see how close you are to your destination. 

There still are a lot of night routes operating within Italy.

Traveling by train is far more environmentally friendly than flying and can be cheaper when things like baggage fees, transportation to the airport, and an extra night’s hotel are factored in:

Takeaways / Things I wished I’d known beforehand 
1) There is no need to buy regional or intercity trains beforehand 

2) The large geographical area of Rome means having to choose between taking the metro to see more historical sites or walking to see more of Rome.  I chose walking and needed 1  or 2 more days to catch what I missed.

3) It’s better to enjoy seeing Rome than trying to cram everything in.

4) I wish I had known about the website that announces train strikes.  The strike that caused my delay to Milan was only announced 2 days before - but I could have made arrangements.

5) I wish I had known that they had closed the coastal trails in CT for maintenance - I didn’t know there was a website for those announcements either.

6) I don’t get the appeal of Venezia.  It wasn’t even crowded and I purposefully went off the beaten path and meandered through the streets.  

7) I love art, but even I got burnt out on art.  I’m very glad I had multiple days I could just walk around or just sit in a piazza for an hour or two. 

8) The wonderful people of Italy are very patient if you’ll make a genuine effort to communicate in Italian.  

9) Getting to the station 15 mins before your train arrives is plenty of time.

10) You don’t need nearly as much cash as you think.  Cash for laundry, post cards, public WC’s is all you need - unless your hotel requires the city tax in cash

11) Everyone has their own preferences.  What I like about Italy you may not and vice versa.   Go where you want to go.  See what you want to see. 

12) I loved Italy and am already planning my next trip.",t2_kzz0t,19 Day Trip Report (November),0.93,13,1706482803.0,1706482803.0,6,brenDaeShus,1adftb7
ItalyTravel,"My wife and I are planning a summer trip and spending about 10 days throughout Italy, mostly in Rome and Amalfi. I’m white and sunburn very easily, I’m also bald so I wear hats everywhere I go in the summer. Mostly baseball caps or, for beaches and such, a bucket cap. My wife and I are doing research and she said no one wears ball caps in Switzerland or Italy and I should leave mine behind and get something local. 

While I don’t mind doing so, I’m wondering if- is it a faux pas to wear hats like Americans traditionally do?

When arriving in Milan, I plan to move from the airport to the hotel using public transportation. I will be taking the train to move from city to city. 

I have read many reviews discouraging travelers from bringing a full-size suitcase (the ones that you typically check in and have to weigh less than 50 lbs). However, I am not sure if a typical carry-on suitcase will hold everything I need for 2 weeks in a country that's new to me (especially during winter time). I typically travel with carry-on only when is a weekend-long trip, but if it's a week-long or more, I always need to bring my full-size suitcase.

I anticipate that the suitcase will only be an issue when I'm transferring from the airport/train terminal to the hotel and vice versa, and I really don't mind going upstairs-downstairs carrying my suitcase, but maybe there are other challenges that I'm not taking into consideration and I would like to hear about your experiences.

ItalyTravel,"Period: November 8 - 17

1. What was good

\- great weather

\- Cheaper prices compared to other countries (based on Western Europe)

\- Food that suits people around the world (pizza, pasta, gelato)

\- Except for a few tourist spots, the employees were generally friendly and spoke good English.

\- Various natural landscapes (from the Alps to Positano)

\- Each city had a distinct personality and was all picturesque.

  
2. What was bad

\-Pickpocket, someone put their hand in my bag on a crowded bus. But fortunately, I spotted it right away, slapped the man's hand hard, and he apologized and got off at the next stop.

(Of course, this is not a disadvantage unique to Italy and occurs in most popular cities in Europe, but as someone who comes from a country with very safe security against minor crimes, I can't help but point it out as a disadvantage.)

\- I knew that sharing pizza was not part of the Italian culture, but I felt a little uncomfortable that they brought other employees to see this as if it were some kind of novelty. It felt like seeing animals at the zoo.

\- Smoking culture, of course, I respect cultural differences, but the sight of people smoking on a train station platform was very unfamiliar to me.

ItalyTravel,"Sharing a recap of my 2-week trip to Italy with my partner (we're early 30s). We went the last week of September and came back mid-October 2024. Visited Rome, Cinque Terre, Florence, Tuscany area, and Venice.

It was our first time in Italy and we've been to other parts of Europe. This subreddit was helpful when I did my planning, so I hope this helps someone plan their trip!

**Preface**

* Only brought carry-ons (1 backpack and 1 roller each). On return, we filled an extra bag and checked it.
* I had a Nomad eSIM (10GB) and hotspotted my partner (their phone has issues with eSIMs and getting a physical SIM was way more expensive). Signal was fine other than in Tuscany, which was very spotty. This has been my experience using Airalo eSIMs outside major cities.
* We primarily used a credit card that doesn't have foreign exchange fees and brought a few hundred Euros in cash, which was hardly needed.
* Trained/bused/walked everywhere other than renting a car in Florence and returning it in Florence. Used it during our 3 days in Tuscany, navigated using Waze (to avoid tolls and check for ZTLs!). Waze was much better than Google Maps for driving instructions.
* I booked major attractions well in advance when tickets were released. The hardest thing to book was the Colosseum full experience. I'm used to booking hard-to-get festival tickets, and this booking was even harder because of the limited quantities per hour. Just keep
* Did one official guided tour (Vatican Museum) but mostly used Rick Steves' audio guides, which were very informative.
* Stays were mostly Airbnbs. A few places had kitchen access to make small meals, which was a nice break. We eat diverse cuisines and balanced meals at home, so I recommend getting some groceries to make light meals to break things up if possible.
* I was mindful of our belongings. Didn't feel it in most places but there were definitely some sketchy people standing around in train stations, probably waiting to swipe phones then run onto trains (I've heard of people's experience). I kept my phone and wallet in a crossbody bag. My partner wore a 3L [Lulu belt bag](https://images.lululemon.com/is/image/lululemon/LW9DHRS_0001_1?wid=1800&op_usm=0.8,1,10,0&fmt=webp&qlt=80,1&fit=constrain,0&op_sharpen=0&resMode=sharp2&iccEmbed=0&printRes=72) (discontinued style), and it was roomy. Backpacks aren't recommended as some museums require you to check them in.

**Day 1-3: Rome** (stayed near Piazza Navona)

* So much history and art. We're not big history or art buffs but gained so much appreciation for everything we saw. Felt like art and history crash course and we ate it up.
* Roman Forum felt like walking in history as you listen to Rick's audio guide. The Colosseum attico was awesome. It's much quieter than the ground level.
* We did an 8:30am guided tour of the Vatican Museum and our Italian (English-speaking) guide was super fast. After it ended just under just under 2 hours later, we walked it again ourselves but the second time was packed like sardines. Go early.
* Art-wise, I was most stunned by the Sistine Chapel. My brain couldn't handle the artistic genius.
* Borghese Gallery looked small from the outside but they packed that place with art and it's not to be missed; being an aristocrat was the life lol
* Trevi Fountain was still normal when we went and going at 10pm was still crowded. Probably still better than daytime. Piazza Navona was under scaffolding and can barely see the fountains in the piazza.
* Food:
   * Ristorante Montevecchio and La Vecchia Roma - great pastas

**Day 4-5: Cinque Terre** (stayed in Vernazza)

* A highlight of the trip. This has been on my bucket list and the Vernazza coastline at sunset made me cry lol
* Weather was spotty during these 2 days and luckily held off enough to hike the Sanctuary of Madonna and got a view of all 5 towns at one point.
* The sea wasn't warm enough for most to swim when it was \~18C although I saw 1 brave family did with their kids
* Wine tasting at Gheme in Riomaggiore was superb. The owner is so knowledgeable and it was easy to love the whites in CT with its minerality. Buy wine here to take home.
* Food: 5 Terre Bistrot. Get the pesto gnocci and fish ragout omg.

**Day 6-8**: **Florence** (stayed near the train station)

* I had high hopes for Florence, but the overall vibe wasn’t a hit for us. I'm attributing it to being there over a weekend (Friday to Monday). It felt more crowded than Rome, which actually felt less overwhelming in comparison.
* The Duomo was unbelievable with its intricate details and themes, like the placement of renaissance artists just below Christ and above the saints. We didn’t climb it but plan to next time!
* The Uffizi was lovely, and seeing The Birth of Venus in person was surreal.
* Food:
   * Gelateria Della Passera served one of the best gelatos of our trip. Excellent dairy-free options too.
   * I'Girone De'Ghiotti had excellent sandwiches. However, the line moves slowly, and there are many other options nearby if you don’t want to wait.
   * Trattoria Sostanza didn’t live up to the hype for us. The famous butter chicken wasn’t the best I’ve ever had, though the artichoke omelet was good. The raspberry pavlova was perfect, though!

**Day 9-11**: **Tuscany** (stayed near Cavriglia)

* Picked up a rental car from Europcar at the Florence train station. I was nervous about this part, but it went smoothly. Cars rented from the station are returned [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UaqM4KxuCymB6jpv8).
* If you turn off tolls on Waze, the routes will take you on smaller roads and sometimes very tight!
* The weather in Tuscany wasn’t great during this time but we still enjoyed it. Stayed at a winery agriturismo, visited a few wineries (bought some wine and olive oil), drove around the Val d’Orcia area (it feels like being in a painting!), got some porcinis and cooked it ourselves, visited Bagni San Filippo (v cool day trip!).

**Day 12-14**: **Venice** (stayed near Santa Croce)

* Venice was another highlight of the trip. We spent our days bopping around eating cicchetti and trying wines. Delightful.
* Discovered my favorite liquor used for spirtzs - Select, which originated in Venice. Served with an olive - bellissimo.
* Attended a Vivaldi concert at San Vidal Church. The church isn’t as grand as others, but the musicians were phenomenal and clearly knew the pieces deeply.
* Take a ride on the vaporettos (public water ferries) at night. It felt magical to see the city lit up and water glisten under the moonlight. Highlight experience for us.
* Bought gifts to bring back: pastries, chocolates, and Italian Nutella (it’s so much better due to their hazelnut sourcing). Bought a bull leather belt (so smooth) at Il Grifone.
* Food:
   * La Zucca was one of our favorite meals—vegetarian and so flavorful.
   * Al Covo was pricey for what it was. Service was attentive. Food just didn't hit.
   * If you love seafood, look for *broeto* on menus—it’s a tomato-based seafood stew. I still think about it!

**Wrap-Up**

* Departure from Venice: our flight was at \~6:30 AM, so the train wasn’t an option. We took the ATVO Airport Coach, which picks you up at Piazzale Roma. You can book tickets online and there are scheduled pickup times; the tickets themselves are flexible with no specific time stamps so you can go at any pickup times. The coach arrived on time and was a seamless experience—only \~25 minutes to reach VCE.
* The time spent in each area felt just right. Rome has so much to offer, and three days were short, but we’re already planning to return!",t2_14kfqi,"Early Oct 2024 Trip Report - Rome, Cinque Terre, Tuscany & Venice",0.82,10,1731801517.0,1731801517.0,5,watermelonpower,1gt0m20

""I should also remind you that at the check-in you are supposed to pay 46 euro (cash) for final cleaning and tourist tax. Thank you!""

We are only staying for 2 nights. Is something wrong here? Tourist tax sure, but cleaning fee? And 46 euros total?

**Update: Thanks for all of the replies here!** I contacted Airbnb Support (which was phenomenal by the way) and they told 3 things:

1. The tourist taxes and cleaning fees should all be included in my cost.
2. If any additional costs are requested, they need to be defined in the listing (they weren't).
3. They should not be using Whatsapp to communicate with me, only Airbnb's chat. If they use WhatsApp, everything they say is no longer evidence when dealing with disputes.

They told me to write in the Airbnb chat, ""I will be declining the additional fees, please reach out to Airbnb with any questions. We will be using Airbnb chat moving forward.""

My guess is that they are using some sort of property manager (since the name on Airbnb is different than on WhatsApp), and they are trying to collect additional cash to make up for the middle man costs. Stay safe!

  
**Update Two: The situation escalated as expected after following the Airbnb support's advice.** The host sent us some hostile and aggressive messages before they reached out to Airbnb support. **Apparently, even the Airbnb support missed the additional hidden fees tucked into their description.** Regardless, this raised even more concerns with us. We did some research and found out that when Airbnb made the big public November 2022 marketing campaign / UI change of ""Fee Transparency! All fees included!"", they actually made a ToS change at the same time. That ToS change states that you can now include hidden fees in descriptions. 🙃 The marketing is so deceptive because when you open the search page it now will always pop up that ""all fees are included"" which then lowers your guard.

The Airbnb support got back to us after re-reading and finding the hidden fees and said it was fair game. We told them that the hostility and aggression of the host made further interaction difficult and requested if we can get a refund to book a different Airbnb due to safety. They obliged, and we are now going to a separate Airbnb.

**PSA: Everyone, read the house rules and descriptions carefully! They are NOT in the main listing page, they are behind a button press and a modal pop-up. You will NOT find them by simply doing a command-f on your browser tabs. If they list variable tourist taxes or additional fees, drop that listing and look for another.

ItalyTravel,"Me+wife+2 kids are traveling to Italy during spring break. We will be there 8 nights.

My tentative plan:

1. Land in Rome on Saturday and stay there until Wednesday
2. Take high speed train to Florence on Wednesday and stay in Florence until Friday
3. Take high speed train to Milan on Friday and stay in Milan until Sunday, fly out of Milan back to US on Sunday

Does this look like a decent plan? Any inputs would be welcome on choice of cities, length of time at each, and any other tips.

Thanks!

Postscript Edit:

Wow thanks for all the suggestions everyone!

I'm glad I posed this question here - I have some clarity now.

I will be doing Rome + Florence, skipping Milan altogether.

I think I might go to Florence first and then Rome, reason being my flights will be @ Rome Fiumicino Airport and it's better to be closer it on the day I fly out of Italy.

On the day I arrive in Italy @ Fiumicino Airport, how tricky is it to get from the airport to Florence via high speed train?",t2_y3al34nr4,Traveling to Italy for one Week in April 2025. Which Cities Recommended?,0.82,11,1728660809.0,1728660809.0,75,Intrepid-Estate14325,1g1cl98

ItalyTravel,"I will be in Rome Oct 1 - 8, one night in Florence on Oct 5th . I have my passport (pretty sure this is the only doc I need), lodging, and transport through Trenitalia and Italo all booked. Essentially, If I arrived in rome and florence with nothing to do in any place, I'd have a guaranteed bed and guaranteed transport until my return flight.

In terms of tickets I have pre booked:

Rome: Vatican City Museums (830 am guided), Colosseum+Forum+Palatine (Colo attic access for 8:50 am, not on same day as Vatican), Castel Sant'Angelo, and Galleria Borghese. The Pantheon I didnt pre book, because on the day I go it will be around 5 pm when I get there, and I've read here that the queue at that time of night at this time of year isnt too bad. Likewise, I do have a Galleria Borghese ticket for 5:45 pm on Friday Oct 4th, but I would like to go Monday (Oct. 1) around 4:30-5 pm. I made sure to get a refundable ticket just in case, so should I be able to queue up at Borghese around that time for a walk in ticket, or am I better off just going at my ticket time a few days later?

Florence: Uffizi gallery and Bruneschellis Duomo I have booked for Oct. 5th after I arrive by train, Coincidentally, I am to be in Florence during the first Sunday of the month, and I have read that is when many things are free. I figured I would get up early and queue at Academia, if that wont be a 3+ hour long excursion. Other than that, I have nothing planned for Florence.

Things I am lacking on (my favorite things in general would have to be movies, food, and history if that gives any ideas):

- Tours/Guides. I prefer to play things by ear, but I also hate missing out on a really cool experience because I didnt research properly. I have no doubt even ""aimless wandering"" will be fulfilling in Rome, but if anyone really enjoyed a local tour or guide they did through a third party that made their trip much better, I'd be open to suggestions for something that takes a few hours out of one of my empty days.

- Food. Very dumb of me, but other than a user here giving me some spots immediately around my hostel, I am lacking completely in where/what to eat. I know theres certain dishes that are ""must try"", but what else should I be looking for. Any restaurants I should try to reserve a spot at? maybe a guided food tour? I am open to anything and everything when it comes to this.

* Shopping. I wouldn't mind snagging a few articles of clothing for keepsake reasons, snack/food items for sure, and of course souvenirs for friends and family. Does anyone have suggestions for flea/street markets, or neighborhoods that usually have these things happening?

This is my itinerary right now: [https://imgur.com/a/LGjCPzg](https://imgur.com/a/LGjCPzg) . Please note that this is an inverse itinerary i.e. its only showing the times I have free and open to book other stuff (eg. Wednesday Oct. 2nd I am doing the vatican, castel sant'angelo, piazza navona, the pantheon, trevi fountain, and the spanish steps from \~8am - 6:30pm, which is why Oct. 2 only list nighttime past 7pm as free, so this might be a good time for resturaunt suggestions for example, if that all makes sense)

thanks for the help at such a late time, most things I am confident I did well but I know I probably missed a few obvious bookings.

ItalyTravel,"Hi beautiful people,  
here just to suggest you a nice new article I stumbled upon, from the prestigious Times.

It describes two destinations in beautiful Emilia-Romagna region, one known but still underrated compared to its value (Ravenna) & one very little known so underrated for sure (Comacchio).

Not great main title ""*The underrated crowd-free alternatives to Venice*"" (unnecessary comparison imho but ok, clickbait needs), much better second title: ""*Ravenna’s historic art and Comacchio’s quiet canals make these twin towns in Emilia-Romagna two of Italy’s best-kept secrets. Here’s what to see, eat and do*.""

I hope this intrigues you to visit other places in Italy besides the usual super-famous (and super-touristic) places: both these cities/towns are few km/mi from Bologna & Ferrara, which are perfectly on the Venice-Florence road/train line so not difficult to add to most itineraries. Enjoy!

1.  I have an Android. I would like my main number to remain active for emergencies (all my bookings were provided my USA #) . But I read that with an Android there is no way to use two sim's at once? I would have to swap to my E-sim therefore making it seem like my main phone # is turned off? (I know whatsapp will still work as long as I have data I think?) but text/phone calls would only come through if they are to the number of my temporary E-sim, not my USA #, Is that correct? Is there anyway to have both active with androids?
2. For an I-phone I read what I want to do above IS POSSIBLE. I just want to confirm it will work as I'm expecting?
3. Any specific recommendations? Tips? Tricks? (paying AT&T $10/day for both of us seems absurd so we would like to try the e-sim route this time)",t2_3mhmcjg5,USA > Italy || E-sim || Android V.S iPhone,1.0,11,1724072280.0,1724072280.0,17,omnip0tent1,1ew142k

From Ostuni, we took many day trips to several locations in Puglia. Alberobello, Martina Franca, Polignano and Mare, Monopoli, Cisternino and then to the Amalfi Coast and back to Rome. 

Now reading around, I found so many tourists talking about all the traffic tickets they get about a year later 😂

When driving, I’ve just attempted to keep up with traffic but stay in the right hand lane. We used Google maps for navigation and it notified us of the traffic cameras. 

I’m sure, after driving around here for a month almost every day….. I’m going to end up with a mailbox full of tickets. 😂

Has anyone avoided getting a ticket in Italy? Locals drive much faster than the speed limit, sometimes the speed limits on highways seem absurd (40kmh) and have people flying by you like you’re sitting still 😂. At home I drive fast but her I just tried to keep up with the traffic in the right hand lane.

ItalyTravel,"I have a lot of questions about the Dolomites culture

I’ll start off with I’m Canadian and I’m visiting Italy and part of our trip is currently in the Dolomites. What is going on up here? This place is beautiful and is almost like a fairy tale and too good to be true. I have a ton of questions and pardon my ignorance but this is new to me and I’m very intrigued on this area. I’m not referring to the bigger towns like cortina, Bolzano and ortisei but the smaller town in between that look like a population of 300-500. 

1. Do people live here full time? 
2. What do the full time people do for a living?
3. Do families grow up here? What do children do?
4. Are there schools or home schools?
5. Seems like everywhere you need to go you need a car and gas is pricey in Italy, how is this afforded? 
6. I can tell a lot of it is based off ski towns, it looks like there are so many different ski towns is the demand really that high? 
7. How is the landscape so perfect? Farmers lawns look like golf courses it is so well kept. 
8. I’ll pause on questions and just compliment the infrastructure. To have all of these towns in such remote areas is incredibly impressive. 
9. What bad things happen out here? Are there any troubles? It seems to good to be true? Underground crime world?
10. How does it change during the winter for lifestyle? Driving on the edge of cliffs in the summer on these tight roads make me nervous, how is this possible in the winter?
11. It seems like the Italian culture has been replaced by Dutch/german how did this happen?
12. Are there rivalry’s between the culture? In Canada the French hate the English speaking. 

I have more questions but I’ll pause there. I apologize if this is offensive to anyone but I’m just trying to learn.

ItalyTravel,"Sorry for the long post, but I’m hopeful that this helps fellow Italy travelers. I got a lot of useful information from this subreddit when I was planning. 

Here was our itinerary:
Days 1-6 (5 nights) Lake Garda. 
Our base was in Sirmione. 

Days 6-7 (2 nights) Lake D’Iseo.
Our base was Lovere. 

Day 8-12 (4 nights) Lake Como
Our base was Perledo.

Day 13-16 (4 nights) Lake Maggiore
Our base was Stresa

It’s important to note that we rented a car for this trip to make moving around a bit easier-definitely recommend this! We were able to explore little towns and villages along the way that we never would have been able to without a car. 

We used ferries very minimally (only in Lake D’Iseo, Lake Como and Lake Maggiore).

Day 1 - Made a stop in the lovely city of Bergamo on our way to Sirmione. Checked into our Airbnb in Sirmione and enjoyed a walk around the town. So quaint  and beautiful! Although crowds of tourists do arrive during the day, the town was quiet during morning and later evening hours. 

Day2- Woke early and drove to the Madonna Della Corona, a unique church built into the rocks of a mountain. Afterwards we drove to Malcesine and wandered around, had the best gelato of our trip here (Dolce Vita)! Followed by an unforgettable wine tasting at Casello Bondoni in Desenzano. 

Day 3- Rented a boat and drove ourselves around Lake Garda (no license or experience needed!) Afterwards, we spent the afternoon at the Thermal Spas in Sirmione. 

Day 4- We drove around the entire lake today with stops in Limone Sul Garda for an excellent lunch at Hostaria al Buongusto! (based on a Reddit recommendation) and visited Riva del Garda. 

Day 5- Day trip to Verona (lovely!)  and dinner back in Sirmione.

Day 6- Checked out of our place on Lake Garda this and stopped in the lovely city of Brescia for a quick visit and lunch. Our next stop was at Bredasole winery in the Franciacorta region for a tasting. Finally arrived in Lovere on the shore of Lake D’Iseo.

Day 7- Drove around Lake D’Iseo. We drove to the town of Sulzano where we took a ferry to Mont Isola, a beautiful huge island in the middle of the lake. Then we drove through the town of Iseo and the town of Pisogne on our way back to Lovere. 

Day 8- On our way to Perledo, which is just adjacent to Varenna, we stopped at a winery in the Valtellina region (ARPEPE-fantastic!) Ferried to Bellagio for a dinner at Dispensa 63- excellent!

Day 9-Took a drive to the little town of Nesso to check out the infamous swim spot (made famous by social media). Rain put a damper on the rest of our day. 

Day 10-Still raining! So we decided to drive to where it WASN’T raining, we decided on a day trip to Parma! Had an excellent lunch (Osteria dei Servi) and tasted all things Parma! Walked around the town. stopped at a fantastic brewery (Terminal 1) on our way back to Perledo. 

Day 11- Spent the day in Varenna. Visited Villa Cipressi and Villa Monastero, as well as Casello Vezio. 

Day 12- Drove our car onto the ferry and explored the town of Menaggio. Drove through some of the other towns on the western shore before heading to Varese for the best pizza (La Piedigrotta)! Then landed in Stresa on Lake Maggiore.

Day 13- Took the ferry from Stresa to the 3 main islands here, Isola Bella, Isola Pescatori, and Isola Madre.

Day 14- Took another ferry, this time to Santa Catarina del Sasso, a convent built  into the side of a cliff (beautiful!)

Day 15- Drove through Baveno and Pallanza (a few towns on the lake) then low key day by the hotel pool. 

Day 16- Back to reality!!! ",t2_ulrj073e,Just returned from a 16 day trip to the Italian Lakes- AMA!,0.68,11,1720954891.0,1720954891.0,44,Starburst_86,1e2zm6g

ItalyTravel,"Hello, 

I did a wonderful trip to Italy with my 18 year old son (mother-son trip).  Here is what we experienced.  Everyone has different things that bring them joy.  The goal of the trip was not to see everything each city had, but to let him have a flavor of various cities, see some significant spots, have a relaxed vacation that didn't feel hassled, and enjoy time together. 

Itinerary:

Lugano:  We stayed in Lugano (Switzerland, Italian is the local language - it's on the border) as the final stop of a road trip through Switzerland.  We rented a boat and enjoyed several hours out on Lake Lugano and walked the town after having driven through the local mountain areas.  Returned the car and shifted to trains. 

Florence:  Florence wasn't a destination, it was a stop between Lugano and Rome so we were only here for a night.  We stayed at a wonderful Bed and Breakfast on the skirt of old town in a building that was built at the same time the Duomo was being built.  The floors of the B&B were the same stone as the top of Duomo which was cool.  We walked the beautiful city in the evening and in the early morning before catching a train to Rome.    

Rome: We stayed in an AirBnB across the street from the Vatican.  We did the last entry time tour of the Vatican and Basilica and a first entry ticket for the Colosseum.  Aside from that we walked and walked and explored.  Took in views of all the major sights and went up and took in views that overlooked the city. 

Pompeii:  We left on the 7am train and arrived at Pompeii at opening time to avoid the heat of the day.  After Pompeii we went in to Naples and headed to the botanical gardens.  The botanical gardens was quite small and mostly green.  We continued to explore and went across the street through an embassy and down to a university where we meandered through the campus coming out near the water and headed to the train station back to Rome. We had a superb pizza lunch for only 5 euro at some random restaurant we passed along the way. 

Bologna/Modena:  We rented a car here so that we could do driving trips around this area.  We enjoyed walking downtown and visiting the flea market, the shops, the bridges, the castle, etc.  Lots of variety of foods to try in this city.  We drove to the Lamborghini, Ferrari and Pugano museums, etc.   We love driving the countryside and taking in the various small towns. 

Verona: We drove to Verona where we found our favorite street market.  We enjoyed lunch outside and an aperitif.  This area was gorgeous and we loved driving through the country and taking in the mountains.  We continued on to Lake Garda and visited the castle.   

Key takeaways:  

End of May was perfect timing.  The weather was in the mid-70's a bit overcast but not rainy, and we didn't have insane crowds for the most part.  Obviously Rome is crazy but we opted to do a lot of our walking to see the fountains, etc. in the late evening and by then the bus tours were in the restaurants and while the streets were populated, I wouldn't call it crowded.  We definitely noticed a spike around May 31 as the locals started to travel for their holiday on June 2.  

Despite having slash proof bags and carrying our items in front, we did still get pickpocketed by a tag team.  The standard block and grab approach that caught my son off guard, he didn't even notice until we got off. The damage was minimal though as we intentionally separated drivers licenses and passports into 2 locations and had divided our credit cards and cash into separate space just in case this happened. I strongly recommend this.  He lost his driver's license ID but not his passport, he had 1 credit card to cancel and only lost about 30 Euro as a result.

We left a bag on a train and learned the lost and found system (another post) which for us worked well and we recovered the bag a few days later. 

We needed antibiotics for an infected toe.  We used a telehealth doctor and the local pharmacies.  FYI - despite having a prescription for Europe, some countries require a dedicated script from that country itself if the script is for an antibiotic due to concerns around antibiotic resistance.   

We loved having a rental car as it gave us freedom to go off the beaten path.  We studied the local rules well as there are several areas in Italy that are zoned in a way that you can't drive through it even though they look like open roads.  The signs are important, also it took a bit of getting used to the paint being different on the streets than where I live. 

Each city has a different vibe at night so we really enjoyed going out both during the day, in the early morning and at night.  If it got too hot we were planning to nap in the heat of the day in our rooms but the weather was so nice we never did. 

We used the Google translate app in camera mode to read Italian only menus as several restaurants weren't focused on tourists so English menus weren't always available.  This was really helpful as it instantly translated the words but you were still reading the menu itself not text blocks. 

Filling up the gas tank took a bit to figure out.  You had to go to a stand and put your card in, then it blocked an amount on the card, then you fill the tank and it reverts out what you didn't spend.  

We preferred staying just outside of the centers.  The metro is so easy to get into the city in minutes and the outskirts lets you be off the beaten path and explore other neighborhoods more easily.  Plus the costs aren't as steep once you are out of the hot spots. 

Plans change.  You see stuff that you want to explore more, or you're relaxing and want to stay longer, etc.  We only bought tickets in advance for a few things that we wanted to ensure we didn't miss, but left the rest of the trip unscheduled so we weren't rushing from spot to spot to hit times. 

Street markets vary significantly.  The one in Bologna was primarily clothing and every day items.  The one in Verona was spot on for buying gifts and had a higher level of quality in the items compared to the one in Bologna. We were glad we did both and didn't assume they'd all be the same.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all! I'm off on my second interrail trip in a couple months, got a ten day pass and my rough plan is three nights in Amsterdam, two in Berlin with a nightjet to Switzerland, two nights in gimmelwald (I'm mostly interested in stargazing and waking up to mountains!!), and then to head down to Italy, coming down into Milan. I'm mostly interested in Italy for the food, the culture, the weather, the history, and the coastline. With six nights planned and five travel days, what should I do?

 My general plan was to head to Florence, with lunch at lake Como, stay at Florence for a couple days then head down to Napoli (naples) and explore the city, taking day trips to Sorrento and Rome. However I genuinely cannot decide whether to stay in Naples or not - I'm solo travelling and due to recent injuries I can't defend myself. Any advice on that?

As far as things I must do, I'd like to 

- Visit some nice coastline, the Amalfi coast seems lovely, although they're tourist hotspots Amalfi and Positano look amazing


- See some good history and culture, unique sights

- Potentially have lunch at a lake

- Enjoy some authentic Italian food

- Not get mugged in Naples

ItalyTravel,"Hello everybody. 

I have specific doubts about my trip to Napoli. I found a very nice hotel, I think it is well located (near the train station) and connected with different transports. HOWEVER, I have read that the area near the train station is dangerous. 
I wanted to ask, especially the locals, if it is true or a perceived danger. 
I'm Mexican, so I'm used to walking (and living ) in not so nice areas. 

When I visited Seattle I stayed in a couple of hotels downtown, in areas with a high number of homeless people, likewise in San Francisco (Mission district) it was an area that could be perceived as dangerous but it seems to me that a lot of the fear is prejudice to ""undesirable"" people (obviously I differ from that idea).

What could (really) happen to me? 

Could I really expect armed robberies, kidnappings or anything of this level? 

Or is it just a not so nice area? 

I would like the opinion of the local people, I saw the Google Maps of the area (my third world eyes see the area very beautiful hehe).  

——————

Salve a tutti. 

Ho dei dubbi specifici sul mio viaggio a Napoli. Ho trovato un hotel molto bello, penso che sia ben posizionato (vicino alla stazione ferroviaria) e collegato con diversi trasporti. Tuttavia, ho letto che la zona vicino alla stazione ferroviaria è pericolosa. 
Volevo chiedere, soprattutto ai locali, se è vero o è un pericolo percepito. 
Sono messicano, quindi sono abituato a camminare (e a vivere) in zone non molto belle. 

Quando ho visitato Seattle ho alloggiato in un paio di hotel del centro, in zone con un alto numero di senzatetto, allo stesso modo a San Francisco (quartiere Mission) era una zona che poteva essere percepita come pericolosa, ma mi sembra che molta della paura sia un pregiudizio verso le persone ""indesiderabili"" (ovviamente io sono di parere diverso).

Cosa potrebbe succedermi? 

Posso davvero aspettarmi rapine a mano armata, rapimenti o cose del genere? 

Oppure è solo una zona non molto bella?

ItalyTravel,"The primary purpose of this trip was a ski trip to the Dolomites, but we wanted to visit some places in northern Italy that we didn't get to on our previous Italian trips. We spent 1 night in Verona, 7 nights in Sëlva, and 3 nights in Milan. In our previous trips, we have visited the Dolomites (Santa Cristina), Torino, Courmayeur, Salerno and Rome.

**Verona**
* We landed in Milan at 9am and immediately trained here and spent 1 night. We didn't want to drive 4 hours off the plane after a redeye flight to the Dolomites so figured Verona was a good midway point.
* We walked in the Verona Arena and saw Juliets house. We went into the big churches and walked along the river and went across some of the cool bridges including Ponte Scaligero which was really cool
* We rented a car from Europcar near Verona train station (absolutely awful experience I posted about a week ish ago) and drove to the Dolomites, with a stop in Bolzano!

**Bolzano**
* We didn't have much time here, 4-5 hours tops which was unfortunate but definitely want to come back!
* We went to the South Tyrol Archeological Museum. We are not big museum people but this was honestly really cool. The museum is themed around a 5000+ year old mummy, Ötzi, who was found frozen in the Alps.  We got to see him as well as other tools equipment, and info from his age.
* One of my best meals at the trip was at Paulaner Stuben for lunch. I know it's not Italian food, but I had the ""Octoberfest"" lunch which included goulash, bratwurst, cabbage salad, potatoes and bread dumplings. Absolutely incredible.

**Sëlva**
* We had perfect skiing conditions last year during our 4 days of skiing. Clear, sunny and below freezing. This was very different and we had maybe 4 hours of perfect weather/conditon throughout our 5 ski days
* It was slightly warmer, snowed and/or rained with little accumulation almost every day. This led to fog and very flat lighting, as well as easy trails getting chopped to shit and becoming mogul fields by the end of the day. These conditions meant we were unable to do our favorite thing from last year, Lagazuoi, although I'm not sure if it was closed due to fog or avalanche danger. We were told ""the horses can't see"" but I'm sure there was more to it
* On our off day, we went to the public pool in Ortisei and went shopping. My wife got a massage. European pool culture is very different than that of the US! 
* Shops in this part of Italy are weird and extremely aggressive. It was common to be followed around the store by an employee and asked if we needed help *everytime* we picked up something. 
* Two of our best meals of the trip were our last two dinners Sëlva at Speckkeller and Baita Pra Valentina, where I had this wonderful pork filet and cheesy black truffle pasta, respectively. 
* We drove back to Verona, returned the car and trained back to Milan. We did all of this pretty early so we still had a full half day by the time we got to Milan

**Milan**
* During our halfish day, we walked around Castle Sforzecso, various churches and went to the Ambrosian Library and crypt next to it.
* The next day, we spent the morning at the Duomo. We climbed the terraces right at 9am, explored the church while mass was going on (odd), went to the museum before heading back to the Duomo go to 11am mass. We're not super religious but we are catholic, and my wife really wanted to go mass in Italy, which just didn't work our are last trip.
* People are so incredibly obnoxious. **Rant Alert.** While we were looking around the part of the church that was open during the 9:30am mass, multiple people would walk up to the guards and ask/complain why half the church was closed. Isn't it obvious? It's Sunday and the priest is literally being shown speaking on TVs throughout the church. During the 11am mass we attended, one guy got yelled at by the usher for taking pictures during the service. Three people walked in 15 minutes late, two sat directly behind me and the other in the pew across the aisle from us. These people proceeded to talk to eachother across the aisle during the entirety of the priest's homily. Wtf!? They relocated after the homily and proceeded stand in front of a column for the rest of the mass and watch the live choir.
* The mass itself was interesting! While we had no clue what they were saying, we were able to follow along. It's very interesting how different a catholic mass can feel in another culture. 
* We spent the afternoon walking around the momumental cemetery, Chinatown and Parco Sempione. Chinatown was interesting and not what I expected. It was small and seemed it was this hip aperitivo area for the Italians. It was very much the opposite of NYC's Chinatown, which absolutely giant and slowly consuming the Little Italy neighborhood next to it.
* Parco Sempione was the only time on the trip I felt slightly unsafe, or maybe sketched out is the correct word. There were men positioned around the park (on benches, workout equipment or behind trees) that would try to interact with you and approach you as you walk by them
* During the evening, we made our way to the Navigli district and explored the canals and ate dinner there. We love neopolitan food and ate at Napoli 1820 Pizzeria. We enjoyed a great bottle of Falanghina, meloncello, bufula mozzarella and some wonderful fish pasta.
* The next day we went to Bergamo, but got back to Milan around 5pm. We went to Santuario di San Bernardino alle Ossa. This church is absolutely wild as it is decorated with many human skulls and bones
* Milan kind of reminded me of NYC, specifically Manhattan. Very fast paced and diverse compared to other places we've been in Italy. I liked it a lot more than I expected to. 

**Bergamo**
* We decided to take a day trip to Bergano, and it was a pretty easy 1 hour train ride from Dateo near our hotel
* From the train, we walked to the funicular and took it up to Città Alta. This was on a Monday so most of the museums were closed, but we pretty did everything on the tourist map we got at the funicular station
* We went to the cathedral and Basilica next to it, walked around Rocca di Bergamo. We also walk along the walls. It was a really cool city and I'm glad we went!
* It was really interesting how Duomo do Milano didn't really care if people walked around during mass. This was in sharp contrast to Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore where they didn't let people in during mass and had signs everywhere to remain quiet and respectful. 
* We took another funicular up to Torre Castello San Vigilio, which had some great views! 


While the skiing was a slight let down, we still had fun and we got to visit some fun cities in Northern Italy!

ItalyTravel,"
Final stop in my 18 day Italy trip with my parents, after visiting Venice, Bologna, Ravenna, Florence, and Sienna. 

Day 1:

Walked from Termini to our airbnb right in Centro near Piazza Navona. This is definitely the place to stay for a first timer, everything we wanted to see was within a 30min walk. 

Walked over to Trastevere, suppli was amazing at Suppli Roma, saw a short lineup for Da Enzo and joined the line. Dinner was great, amatricina carbonara and oxtail. Stumbled upon the Chiesa di Sant (amazing ceiling fresco). 

Day 2: 

Booked Pantheon ticket the night before for 9am opening. After almost two weeks, using that website was the first time my card issuer (wealthsimple) decided to put a hold on my card post- transaction. Quick call and it was sorted. 

Short lineup outside at opening, not too crowded inside. Could have skipped the online payment if i showed up later. 

Sant'Agnese in Agone was also beautiful on the inside. Walked to Trevi Fountain, its ok, and then walked to Spanish steps and into villa borghese. Loved all the green space here and wandered for a while. Lunch at Al 34, loved the orrichette here, but also the only time we ordered that. Chilled out at Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele for sunset. Dinner at Roscioli Salumeria con Cucina, which was good, but not sure I need to go back when there are so many other options. One of the pastas seemed less than al dente.

Day 3:
Vatican day. I had prebooked the 830am entry. Got there by 8am and lineup was already big. Wow this museum was overwhelming big, used the Rick steves guide which covered the highlights. Sistine chapel was crowded as expected, but found a good seat and spent 30 minutes marvelling at it all. Didnt try to use the right door to St Peters, seemed like it was for groups only, could have feigned ignorance? 

Walked around the outside, had lunch, lineup for St Peters was halfway around but was only 30min in the end. Dinner at Emma, good pizza but favourite was the cacio e pepe which I enjoyed better than night before. 

Day 4:
Got lucky and booked the 8:50am attic ticket. I was so confused by which ticket and how to book thesez so thanks to this sub for the help (tip, use the search function). What a special experience to be up there with just a few other ppl. Lunch at RUVER Teglia Frazionata, which was my favourite pizza al tagio. Spent afternoon in the Forum, walked into all the SUPER sites. Palatine hills and Forum were overwhelming tbh, wished we had more time here, and in hindsight would have come here the next day since the ticket is valid for two days, one entry. Dinner at Dar Poeta, solid pizza. 

Day 5:
Final day. Nothing planned at all. Started with a sunrise run pass the pantheon, colosseo, the pyramid, along the Tiber, the vatican, piazza del popolo. Turns out there was a 15k race later that morning, should have signed up for it. Had a porchetta at Panino Ingegnoso, 2nd best of the trip, best was in Sienna. 

Stumbled into the Campagna Amica Market. Packed with locals. Bought some pecorino cheese to take home, ate some fritta for lunch. Walked over to Largo di Torre Argentina, grabbed a slice from Alice since everyone else was eating it. Great pizza al tagio. Had the bufala pistachio gelato at Ruma Bottega, which was up there with the best of the trip. Dinner at Maritozzo Rosso, which was my favorite pasta out of places we tried here. Suppli, alicia, maritozzo, carbonara and cacio e pepe. They specialize in savoury maritozzos, but the pastas were my fav. Good last meal. Picked up some more pizza at Antico Forno Roscioli for the flight home. 

Day 6:
7am flight from FCO, booked at 4am taxi with Freenow day before. First taxi ride of the trip. Went smooth, pickup confirmed minutes after booking, driver arrived on time, cost 58euro with the extra service charge. Coffee and cornetto at the Eataly while we waited for our flight with lots of time (bag check and security was fast, <30min). Best airport cafes I've been to. 

Overall, great first trip to Italy, sticking to the standard tourist sites with my parents. Ill be back for sure to explore more of the natural beauty of Italy, dolomites and the Valle d'Aosta in particular, and the south. 

would try to learn some more italian next time, but a couple weeks of Duolingo definitely helped with basics. Everywhere we went felt very safe, arguably safer than home. I'll miss the plentiful cafes, trattorias and beautiful artwork everywhere. Thanks for the reccos everyone!

ItalyTravel,"took the ferry from Sorrento to Capri around 9am. first on my list was the Monte Salaro chairlift and Anacapri so I made my way there on foot. saw a bus stop but I couldn't tell if it went to anacapri, so I took the steps.

in all my Capri research I did not see anything about the steps for some reason. 🥲 wow, they were a hike! it took about 30 minutes to get up. I can't imagine going in the summer when it is hotter - the weather was 70F/21C and I was sweating and got eaten by mosquitoes. the views were absolutely amazing though.

I had a croissant and cappuccino at the restaurant right next to the chairlift, which were delicious. the chairlift wait was about 10 minutes around 10am. once on, it was a chilly (especially at the top) but beautiful and peaceful. probably took about 20 minutes round trip. 

I walked to Anacapri from there, maybe 10 minute walk. it wasnt busy and the shops were reasonably priced. for example, tshirts were 20$, jackets 25-40$. there were higher end shops too. I stopped in a couple cafes and bars for snacks and drinks as I made my way back to the chairlift area, and nothing was expensive. I especially loved all the artistic gates, gardens and homes along the way.

the bus line was long and I was unsure of the wait times, so I just took a taxi for $25 to  giardini de agusto. the taxis were open air which felt so nice (my hair was a mess after though).

once I arrived to Capri town, I could immediately sense a different vibe. it was pretty crowded, lots of souvenir shops and high end stores. I didn't bother trying to eat or drink at any of these places so can't comment on the price or quality.

the garden was beautiful but very small. only cost $2 to get in. you can get the same (or better) views going straight past the garden. I had the place to myself. there are also winding stairs to get down to the water but I was done with stairs at that point haha. it was around 2-3pm by then.

I took a taxi down to the dock and had a $10 beer while I waited for my ferry at 4pm. the dock shops are obviously very touristy and filled with the same items. note that if you want to leave the island early, some ferries will be flexible.

things on my list I did not get to see: the natural arch, villa lysis, the grottos, and some hikes that would have taken a couple hours. I would have liked to spend more time there but unfortunately didn't have time to wait for busses and didn't want to pay $25 per taxi ride to get to the different sites. I suppose if I was staying there I would just wait for the busses or maybe rent a scooter?

I definitely recommend going to Anacapri area. a tour of the island by boat would have been lovely as well, but if you are only able to explore the main town and Marina you would miss out. if I would have started there, I would have been disappointed to be honest. late october weather was gorgeous and I was very fortunate that the rain forecasted for the week cleared up.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone!

I've been researching endlessly for this trip, but I keep running into conflicting information. I thought it would be better to get advice from real people rather than internet bloggers!

My mother, who is 70 years old, recently had spinal surgery that has affected her mobility. She’s not in a wheelchair but can’t walk for long and tires easily. I’m factoring in the flight as well, knowing it will be quite a challenge for her.

She’s a huge foodie who loves a good glass of wine and enjoys cooking. We both love nature, greenery, fresh air, and water. Neither of us speaks the local language, but I’ve been learning some basic greetings and food-related phrases to be polite.

I’ve heard that there might be a test required to drive or rent a car—is that true? Ideally, we’d prefer not to drive and would rather stay in a place with reliable public transportation and minimal need for travel. 

I'm hoping the trip will be about a week to a week and a half (as she still isn't retired and, being this is a surprise gift, I can't be too intense with scheduling). Ideally the town/area we stay will have enough to do that we wouldn't get bored after 2 days of exploring.

ItalyTravel,"Hi All! I was recently in Italy August 8th-17th. From August 8th-12th my husband and I were in Rome and took one day trip to Florence. I hope this information helps some of you as you are planning your trip :)

Day 1 Arrived in Rome. We stayed at Hilton Eur La Lama. It is a newer hotel about a 20 minute Metro ride to the Colosseum.  It has nice air conditioning and lovely breakfast in the morning. The outlets were funky in the room. Did not have a problem with the elevators or the construction noise outside. The metro was confusing at first for us to understand. We thought we had to buy physical tickets, but then later realized we can just tap our credit card for a ride. We each needed a physical credit card. You cannot share a credit card to buy two separate rides. The ticket validation never happened on the metro, but it did later in our trip when we took Buses in Sicily. We ate at Osteria da fortunata for dinner, then went to giordi for a bottle of wine at Campo De Fiori. I had a lot of high hopes to be able to wander around away from the tourist areas for dinner. But in 100 degree heat it just wasn’t the reality.  Staying out of the city, we didn’t really have the luxury to nap in the middle of the day. I was happy with my meal at Osteria Da Fortunata. I’ve seen some poor reviews here in this sub but you can do far worse than going here to eat. 

Day 2: Slept in. Went to St. Peter’s Basilica and waited in the security line at for approximately 20 minutes at 3pm. Walked over to the Vatican at approximately 4:20pm, there was a long line at first but as we got closer to the entrance, someone who worked there asked if we had 4:30pm tickets or 5pm tickets, we were ushered into a much shorter line. The wait time to get into the Vatican museums was also approximately 20 minutes. We listened to Rick Steve’s free guide. At the Vatican museums, the grounds are massive and a bit tricky to navigate without a guide, but we for the most part followed the flow of the crowd. It was busy but not an unbearable sea of people and I am happy I booked a later time. We had the 5:45pm happy hour tickets. It was a welcome break and after the happy hour we continued through the museums to the Sistine Chapel. Exiting the chapel, there is a gift shop, but then we realized there are an additional 3 gift shops (increasingly bigger in size and variety of gifts) as you make your way out of the museums. People sell parasols, hand fans, and water. There are plenty of free nasoni fountains around the city and there is no need to buy the bottled water. I bought an electric hand fan, scarf, and umbrella on Amazon and I used all 3 constantly. After making our way back to termini, we walked 15 minutes to Come Il Latte gelateria. This was the best gelato we had our entire trip!

Day 3: Took the high speed train from Termini to Florence. Stopped at Mercato Centrale for an express. Went shopping for a leather at Vale. Then went to the Accademia. Ate lunch at Il Basilico and got the florentine steak. Very happy with the food there! Made a reservation through the fork app and they honored a 30% discount. Walked to the boboli gardens. It was a very steep hill to climb to get there. Had I known we would not have done that because of the hot weather. The views were nice of the city. Walked back crossing the Ponte Vecchio bridge. Had a quick pizza for dinner at Mercato Centrale before getting the train back to Rome. Really loved the Hugo Spritz drink a lot more than the Aperol Spritz. 

Day 4: Last full day in Rome. Saw the Baths of Caracalla, then walked to the cat sanctuary, then went to the pantheon. My husband wanted a drink at a tourist trap restaurant near the Pantheon. Called Vineria Hosteria. I couldn’t get away from there fast enough. Then ate at La Picolla Cuccagna. I thought the food here was just ok, but it was so hot my husband wanted to sit here because they had fans with mist blowing. It was a welcome relief after walking in the heat all day. We also stopped in a few churches. 

Day 5: Flew to Palermo in Sicily. Will write a separate post on the second part of the trip when I have time. ",t2_e2caw0dl,Vacation Summary Part 1,1.0,10,1724635571.0,1724635571.0,3,Rescuecatmom,1f1cbol

ItalyTravel,"Hi all,

I'm planning a week-long trip (late August) for me and my gf, where I will propose to her. For this trip, I'm looking for a nice hotel with a swimming pool and views. My budget isn't $20k for this trip, so those White Lotus hotels are out, but I am willing to spend around $7k on hotel. I've found decent hotels on both Lake Como and Taormina, Sicily, but I'm looking for insight on which one to choose. For this trip, I'm looking for more of a relaxed vibe, beach days with dining out and going for drinks at night; not much historical exploring as we did that last summer. Mainly, I'm looking to have a beautiful view somewhere so I can propose, (preferably on a beach). I'm kind of out of my depth, not sure what to pick.

ItalyTravel,"Just came back from a 2 week trip and we spent 4 days in lake como. When doing my research I found there wasn’t a ton of advice on Lake Como so here are some of my takeaways! 

1. Stay in Varenna. Between Bellagio, Menaggio and Varenna, Varenna is by far the best option in my opinion. The other two towns are still cute but Varenna was highly recommended on past threads here and I’m so happy I listened. It’s close to train station, small and cozy, beautiful paths throughout town, amazing views and food. Feels less touristy than the other two towns. It also has a playground if you plan on bringing small children! There also isn’t a road going through the town so it’s all walkable. 

2. Prepare for rain. Pack an umbrella or rain jacket. We went in middle of summer and it rained nearly everyday 

3. If staying in Varenna eat at Al Prato & Il Cavatappi. Try to make reservations in advance. They don’t have online booking systems so you’d have to call. We went there the first day we arrived to make reservations while we were there and they were both booked out for several nights. Al Prato was life changing. Honorable mention for Bon Bon gelato. The best in Varenna. 

Menaggio Recommendations-

Divino 13 had the best espresso martini I’ve ever had and the passion spritz was delicious. Must try for drinks.

The best gelato of our entire trip was at La Fabrica del Gelato. So creamy and delicious! 



Bellagio recommends-

I Giardini di Villa Melzi was beautiful. Highly recommend. If you walk through the garden you’ll come to the other entrance past the large white building. Exit the garden and walk a half mile to the Riverside Snack Bar. There’s barely any reviews online and they don’t have their menu posted but we had the most lovely lunch by the water here. It’s off the beaten path so it wasn’t crowded compared to other places in Bellagio. They have a small beach and even a floating dock you can swim to and jump off of. I had the best pina colada of my life here. Walk back to gardens after your meal and enjoy the rest of it while you walk back towards Bellagio! 


Honestly I wish I could give tips for the Ferry system but it was so confusing and every time we thought we understood the schedule it changed on us. They should really convert to a digital system.

ItalyTravel,"Dear Italophiles and Italians,



I want to experience Italy for a few months. I am making a short list of where to stay and experience this beautiful country.

Important: I am not interested in covering a lot of area, but to take a deep dive into Italian culture in one or two cities. I say this because I am not a complete foreigner to Italy. I used to live in Germany and made multiple trips to Italy. I spent a month in Bolzano once (not the most Italian of cities, I know).

All I know from Italy lies north of Rome and Rome itself.

A bit about me. I'm in my early 30s, and I'm a writer. So you might deduce that I love art and reading. Coffee shops are a must too, but those are ubiquitous. I'm not that big on nightlife. A bar once in a while to wind down and chat. I also love taking walks as the sun sets. So safety at night is a must.

By the way, *parlo la bella lingua italiana e ho raggiunto livello C1.* I almost passed the advanced Italian test, except for the damn written part. But hey! At least I can say I speak Italian, just not write it!

Anyways. my shortlist is the following: Florence, Rome, Bologna, Naples in order of preference.

Is there another city I should consider? What about cheaper alternatives? Take into account that the language won't be a problem. I hope? If there is a dialect, I could be in trouble with older people. In the north, speaking to the elderly has never been a problem, but in the south, may be? Again, never been there.

Husband, baby and I rented a car in Venice and drove up to the dolomites in mid June. We stayed three days in the west and three days in the east which worked well to avoid long drives back and forth. 

In the west (we stayed in Kiens as ortisei was too expensive for a last minute booking)
- hiked Seceda (cable car up from ortisei, pretty exxy, and walked to rifugio firenze for lunch and then further down to Santa Cristina)
- Alpe di Siusi - drove up after 5, and just walked around. SO beautiful. 
- drove the Sella pass
- Lago di braies (walked the loop, worth it), Dobbiaco, Landro, and drove by Misurina and Auronzo (so so blue and beautiful)

In the east (we stayed in San Nicolo Di comenico, Cortina would have been a better choice to minimise travel time):
- Tre Cime Di lavaredo (4-6 h to slowly walk the loop at the top. Drove to the car park around 11am and had many stops along the way for food and photos)
- had a chill couple of days near where we stayed

• 6:00AM - my husband left for work and i told him if he can check Colosseum tix for me while im asleep (talked to him while i was asleep yes lol)

• 7:00AM - hubby told me that he checked at 7 and said that no tickets for July 6 were open yet.

• 8:01AM - i managed to wake up again, checked tix and WOW luckily July 6 is open! But unfortunately sold out for the English guided tour tix. A few available slot for Italian and Spanish tour tho.

ItalyTravel,"My girlfriend and I are planning our first trip to Italy in Sept 2024. We have direct flights in and out of Rome. We will be there for 10 nights. I am trying to determine where we should go and how much time spent in each place. I know some people say for your first trip it makes sense to hit the 3 main places (Rome, Florence, Venice) but we have more interest in the Almafi Coast region. We are both two fit individuals and have no problem walking. Here's a couple options I've been thinking of. 

  
Day 1: Arrive 7:05am in Rome. How long does it take to get your checked bag and get out of the airport? I'm wondering if it's feasible to grab your luggage and get a taxi to Roma Termini which according to my research is roughly 45 mins away.  If so, I'd think we'd arrive around 10:00am. Get on a train and go to Florence assuming it's a 1.5 hr train ride and arrive around 12:30. Go to hotel leave luggage. Go explore. (does this make sense or does this sound like way to much travel? Input appreciated)

  
Day 2: Explore Florence 

  
Day 3: Explore Florence

  
Day 4: Check out as early as possible, get a train from Florence to Sorrento. If anyone's done this how's there experience been? Looks like the Train is about 4.5 hours long with a 20 minutes stop in Naples. Arrive in Sorrento around 12-1pm. Explore Sorrento and check in. 

  
Day 5: Explore Sorrento. Day drip to Positano? How long does this take, is it a full day or a half day activity?

  
Day 6: Boat to Capri? Or go to Pompeii. Explore Sorrento

  
Day 7: Explore Sorrento/Last night

  
Day 8: Wake up early leave Sorrento and take a Train to Rome. It looks like that takes about 2 hr 45min. Get to Rome around 12pm. Check in, explore Rome. 

  
Day 9: Explore Rome, sight seeing

  
Day 10: Explore Rome, Last night in Italy, 

  
Day 11: Flight departs Rome at 10:30AM



What do you think? Is this too much travel all over the place? Another thought was on Day 1, rather than going right to Florence we could stay 1 night in Rome and leave for Florence on Day 2. Spend 2 nights, then go to Sorrento, then end in  Rome. Open to all suggestions and Appreciate anyone who actually took time to read this mess🤣",t2_a1czjwob,10 Day Italy Itinerary.

ItalyTravel,"Hi I’ve been looking at ways to do this. However I’m a bit concerned that on top of an 18€ fee the boat guys demand a 10€ tip per person riding. Should people actually pay this? I’m confused and a bit concerned that going there is just another tourist scam and not worth being hassled. If there’s a best way to do this please let me know. Thanks  

EDIT: I’ve looked into this now so I’ll add a bit of information for anyone who might want to know. 

The Grotto although beautiful and of historic importance is a bit of a tourist trap and people are being caught unawares. 

There is a bus that goes to the grotto for about €3. You don’t need a boat tour to take you there. Most of the boat tours won’t tell you that they only take you to the cave entrance not inside. It’s costs €18 to go inside - part of that is an entrance fee and part of that is for the boat that takes you in. You could be waiting a very long time in the hot sun to go in and only then you’ll se it for 5 minutes unless you give the oarsman more money. 

A lot of people have a lovely experience but some have reported some unscrupulous oarsmen on the boats becoming verbally aggressive and demanding a tip from each passenger of about €5 to €10 euros. The boat is paid for when you go inside - you are under absolutely no obligation to tip unless you feel like you want to. Don’t get scammed and have a lovely day.",t2_5a8kdsb3i,Best way to visit the Blue Grotto in Capri without being extorted?,0.75,10,1712418358.0,1712418358.0,40,Away-Description2973,1bxeo2u

ItalyTravel,"After reading countless posts about the Colosseum I tried my best to book arena/underground tickets. I got up in the middle of the night and for a looong time hit ""refresh"" hoping some availability would show up. Eventually I got a page that said ""Forbidden"" and could no longer ""check availability."" I'm assuming the website thought I was a robot because I then tried with my phone, by taking it off wifi, and I could continue refreshing. Anyway, at the end of it all, we did not get tickets for the arena or the underground and I'm looking for advice. We do not want to spend the money on a third party guide, please help me decide what will give us the best experience (travelling with 2 teenagers).

1. Try again for the tickets one week out and one day out. Is this a big risk because if we don't get them we might not get inside the Colosseum? We're looking for Saturday April 6 and can't be flexible so not sure the likelihood of tickets popping up. 
2. Stand in the queue early in the morning and hope we get arena/underground tickets. Does this ever happen? What type of tickets are available when you stand in the queue? Would we get in if we arrive at 7:30 or 8?
3. Buy regular ticket and be satisfied without seeing the arena/underground?
4. Buy Visit with an Archaeologist Tickets? I would also like to see the S.U.P.E.R sites but the add on says it's only valid with regular ""Ticket Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine\_24h"" tickets. Is it true we won't be able to add on S.U.P.E.R to an Archaeologist Ticket (the way it's worded on the site suggests this)?

Will be renting a car. Always trying to keep travel under 3 hours a day except the last day.

3 days Florence 
2 days random stops up/back to Dolomites (maybe Venice)
2 full days dolomites 
2 day Travel back to rome

It’s around 14 days.

Saturday 26th - Explored Pisa and did some grocery shopping!

Sunday 27th - I just relaxed in my hotel and went out exploring Pisa again!

Monday 28th - I took a day trip to Lucca from Pisa and back before the Luca comics madness started. Was a beautiful city!

Tuesday 29th & Wednesday 30th

I took a day trip to Florence/Firenze from Pisa and back! I absolutely loved it. Such a beautiful city. I just wished I had more days to explored Firenze!

Apparently he said to me ""you've stepped on to my painting and I want something back for it otherwise I'm calling the police"" I just walked away from him until I have managed to find safety. 🤣🤣🤣 A 'poor' lady asked me for some euros. I said to her 'No' and then she did a 'raspberry face' at me!  🤣🤣 In the end, I didn't let that bother me as some people can be idiots!!<

ItalyTravel,"Hello,

My wife and I are going to spend a month in Italy, but we have a budget for the accommodation that is probably on the low-mid side (1500-1800 USD a month) 
We been to Itlay before as part of our honeymoon, but now we want to spend a long time in a city to experience the Italian Europian lifestyle and try to live like a locals instead of tourists ( try )

Anyway, We were supposed to stay in Rome and we found an Airbnb and everything was good, until the host declined our reservation cause we have a baby, so now back to square one, but the problem is that now all the good aribnb’s are out of our budget in Rome.

We found a good deal in Florence, but we’re afraid that a month is waay too much in Florence.

Do you think it’s too much? Are there hidden gems in Florence ? A nearby places we can visit ? We don’t want to feel like we’re bored 🥱 and we’re trapped in a city we explored every single street in it.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone,

I'm visiting Rome from September 3rd to 10th, and I just discovered that booking tickets in advance for the Colosseum is crucial. I’ve been trying to get tickets for the Colosseum Full Experience (Attic and Underground) for over a week, but they’re sold out. I'm really getting lost by reading the possibilities.

Since my girlfriend and I are both under 25, we only pay €2, so I bought the ""24H - Arena"" ticket to at least visit the Arena. However, I believe this only gives us 20 minutes in the Arena, which doesn’t seem like a great value.

I’ve read that additional tickets might be released about 7 days in advance, but I haven’t seen any new availability for the dates I need. It seems like the new website for ticketing doesn’t show any new releases as it used to on the old site. Third-party sites seem extremely expensive, so those options aren’t ideal (160€ for a ticket?!)

**Options I’m considering:**

[FULL EXPERIENCE TICKET WITH ENTRY TO THE ARENA](https://ticketing.colosseo.it/en/eventi/full-experience/): From what I understand, this would include access to the Colosseum and the Arena.

[A NIGHT AT THE COLOSSEUM](https://colosseo.it/en/tickets/a-night-at-the-colosseum/): I’ve heard this might include the Underground, but it’s more expensive (€28) and tickets become available 7 days prior.

Does anyone have advice on other ways to experience a “full experience” at the Colosseum or tips on securing tickets? Any suggestions or recent experiences would be greatly appreciated. This ticket system seems so complicated, unfortunately - and seems to be entirely different then most ""tips"" claim, as the site changed a couple of months ago.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in the process of planning a very important surprise trip with my girlfriend to Tuscany, and wondered what would be recommended here.

The current itinerary is as follows

Day 1-3 : Florence

Day 3-5: Montepulciano/Montalcino

Day 5-7: San Gimignano

Day 7-8: Pisa (flying from Pisa back home)


So basically, I’ve found a couple airbnbs, the one in Montepulciano is lovely but doesn’t have a pool and is more central to the town. The one in Montalcino has a private pool with breathtaking views across the countryside. I’m edging towards the one with the pool as we will be doing a lot of exploring around Florence the first few days and similar the last few days so I figured maybe one less intense day around the pool with perhaps a trip into town for dinner may be nice. However I would scratch that if it’s really not as nice a place to stay!

Any advice would be welcomed. Also - my girlfriend doesn’t drink so are there good options on alcohol free wine or what would be recommended? I’m aware it’s a hugely famous region for wine production but I don’t want her to miss out if there’s good other options.

Many thanks :) 

P.S.  the places we are staying are also just bases of operation where I thought looked nice to wander around in the evening as we will have a car and go out on day trips most days (other than when in Florence/pisa).

ItalyTravel,"After 2 days and 3 nights in Rome, we headed to Umbria for a taste of the Italian countryside.  

We travelled via train from Termini to Perugia. Not sure how we would have gotten all our bodies through Rome without a van booked via Viator. Trains are a little stressful for the uninitiated and moving tons of baggage was a pain. So giving extra time is a good idea. I was stressed rushing between transfers but probably not necessary. Didn’t seem like anyone was getting left behind.

Rented a car in Perugia via Sicily by Car. They take a 2 hour break from 1-3pm so we sat for a while at the train station. Once on the road it was super easy to use Apple Maps. We stayed in Poreta, outside of Spoleto. A bit out of the way but the hotel (Borgo Della Marmotta) was phenomenal. Like a country villa dream. Stone buildings. Pool. Olive groves. Right on the Via di Francesco which was very cool. Definitely recommend. Restaurant there was delicious and we all agreed made the best carbonara (our kids are treating this like the Italian version of chicken tenders: their fallback dinner choice). 

We got breakfast stuff for the week at a local supermarket where we discovered we weren’t in Rome anymore (Ie no one spoke English) and we got to use our basic Italiano. 

We visited four of the nearby towns and each one became our new favorite. Gubbio, Spello, Spoleto, and Assisi. Each has its own personality although they definitely share similarities. I’m glad we didn’t try for more because they do start to blend together. We spent a couple weeks ahead of the trip watching YouTube videos to try and narrow down which towns to visit.

First day, we rode the gondola in Gubbio which was uniquely memorable. The views from the top are beautiful as is the minor basilica. The 800 year old remains of Saint Ubaldo on display got a lot of interest from everyone: a mix of awe and revulsion that was interesting to discuss. The town itself was super sleepy for a Saturday: felt like there were about 100 people wandering the town. The architecture really captured the imagination. We stumbled on Taverna Lobo for lunch which was delicious but with white linens and heavy meat dishes were a bit much for a lunch. That evening we had dinner at Agriturismo Il Cerreto which felt more like eating in someone’s home than anything else. Kids playing. Family members in and out. Grandma and Grandpa cooking homemade everything. Pretty cool experience. Food wasn’t our favorite but the hospitality was awesome. 

Next day we visited Spello. We entered the town from below and went to Sunday mass. The main church (Maria Maggiore) was closed for renovations but the church a half block up the street (St Andreas) was charming and a memorable experience. We wandered the streets admiring all the flower decorations and continuing up up up the hill. We stopped at Porchellino Divino which had amazing sandwiches; some voted it their favorite meal in Italy so far. The “Del Boss” porchetta sandwich was A+. We really just wandered and admired the charm and obvious pride that the residents have for their micro gardens. 
That evening we went to dinner in Spoleto. We walked from the lower town up to the main Piazza del Mercato. It was during the Due Mondi and the town was really alive. Tons of people out and the piazza was actually crowded and super vibrant. We ate at Osteria del Matto and it was our favorite meal. 6 courses of traditional dishes prepared so simply. It really impressed all of us. The grandmother came out to check how everything was and it was just perfectly quaint and delicious. 

On our last day we went to Assisi and it ended up being our favorite of all. Beautiful flower balconies (there is an annual city competition for best) and endless streets to explore. It might be a bit touristy compared to other towns but we were coming off of Rome so it felt relatively quiet. The churches and basilica were gorgeous and held a lot of value for our family. We did a private tour of Assisi which we really thought made a big difference in being able to enjoy the town. We ended the day with dinner at a restaurant called Trattolivo near our hotel which was run by a family that produces a variety of olive oils. So the oils were kind of the star of the show. Really delicious. 

Overall, Umbria met all of our expectations. Much of it was certainly an agricultural community and the natural beauty of the lush green hills and valleys really made us fall in love. ",t2_6z84y,Travel report part 2: Umbria,1.0,10,1720474558.0,1720474558.0,5,Burlydog,1dykvki

ItalyTravel,"I'll be traveling to Rome and Florence with my 70-something parents in late Fall. I'm curious about what are good ways to find good value for money when eating out.

In the US, where I'm from, I'd use Yelp mostly, and cross reference with a couple of other review sites. I know Yelp doesn't have much of a footprint outside the US. Tourist trap businesses also tend to have reviews that focus more on the visual aesthetics and Instagram-ability of a place than on the uniqueness of the food. So it's harder to separate the food focused criticism from the experience focused ones.

Usually I'd walk around and just check different places out, or try neighborhoods outside the tourist trap areas, but I'll be a bit limited with those possibilities because my parents can't get around too quickly. They'd prefer vegetarian places so that's an additional constraint. There can be meat on the menu but they can't have too much of it before they have an upset stomach. 

We wouldn't necessarily want to only eat Italian - anything that'd be hard to find elsewhere would be great. I've eaten incredible Persian food in London, and great Ethiopian food in Barcelona, which were both unlike what I've had of those cuisines in the (West Coast of the) US. In fact, if Rome and Florence are known for any cuisine of a specific immigrant community, that would be great to know too.

Just to compare, I have been to Paris five times in the last 8 months and for each trip, I did tons of research in advance. There was a million things that always kept me occupied cause the city and its activities are massive. I kind of love having a packed agenda for each day. 

To give you an idea of what kind of solo traveller I am, the times I was in Paris I did stuff like: a water park (emphasis on the various slides that gave me a nice adrenaline kick), a funfair, fashion exhibitions, going to the movies, cheap massage, immersive exhibitions, going to a club, interesting museums, etc. 

I know Milan is not Paris and that it's not as massive but it's still metropolitan. 

So my question: are there activities that I should maybe book in advance? To ensure that I will keep my agenda packed. I'm worried that I will spend the 4 days stressing about what to do.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all! I'm going to Italy with my husband and some friends soon. This has been a dream of mine for a while. I'm trying to get the most out of the trip while keeping in mind that the group doesn't want to be moving around too much/cramming too much into each day. So we need some chill days and rest time built in. The big ask is that we stay in the same hotel multiple nights before moving to a new one, so we won't have to pack/unpack every couple of days. So I need cities that are good jumping off points for day trips, that we will then return to for multiple nights. 

Planning to go late summer. We're willing to splurge on some special things, but for the most part we want to keep costs reasonable (Restaurants $ and $$, lodging under $400/night, etc.). 

Anyway, here's my proposed itinerary! I would love any tips or comments :) 

Legend: Day # (city we will be sleeping in) - activities, eateries. 

ITINERARY: 

Day 1 (Rome) - Fly into Rome early afternoon. Check into hotel and walk around. Historic food market: Campo Dei Fiori, Forno di Campo de’ Fiori, La Prosciutteria Trevi. Dinner at Ristorante Pancrazio, which stands on the remains of the Theater of Pompey.

Day 2 (Rome) - Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum. Lunch: Pomodorum ($10 pasta plates, highly rated), Dinner: Negresco Pizzeria ($10-20)

Day 3 (Rome) - Wake up early to see the Trevi Fountain. Knights of Malta Keyhole. Vatican City (Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basillica) **But some people have told me to skip Vatican City. Thoughts?** Long lines, not worth it? Dinner: Trattoria Da Enzo al 29 ($20-30)

Day 4 (Florence) - Early train from Rome to Florence. Piazzale Michelangelo for lookout views of the city. Lunch: Fratellini Sandwich Shop. Walk around the area. Pre-dinner drinks at Loggia Roof Bar. Dinner near Loggia (Tattoria La Casalinga, Trattoria Sant'Agostino, or Osteria Santo Spirito)

Day 5 (Florence) - Tuscany day trip (pasta making class, wine tasting, market visit) 

Day 6 (Florence) - Uffizi Gallery, Statue of David, Duomo. Dinner: Trattoria Marione

Day 7 (Florence) - Souvenir shopping (handpainted local ceramics if possible), climb the tower in Palazzo Vecchio. **\[I think there needs to be more on this day but I don't know what else to do. Help please!\]**

Day 8 (Positano) - Bullet train from Florence to Naples, then pizza in Naples, then van to Positano. Check into hotel and walk around to find a place for dinner. **\[I was convinced by an influencer to spend a bunch of time in Positano, it's their favorite place, etc. But I've also seen some comments here on Reddit from people who don't like it as much. So I'm confused. Please help!\]**

Day 9 (Positano) - Relaxing beach day at Da Ferdinando Beach Club (reserve umbrellas in advance). Restaurant on site. Bring water shoes because the beaches are all pebbles. 

Day 10 (Positano) - Uber from Positano to Pompeii tour pickup. Small group tour of Pompeii and Herculaneum (all day). Uber back to Positano hotel. Dinner. 

Day 11 (Positano) - Boat day to Capri. Small group tour with swimming time and lunch/shopping on Capri. 

Day 12 (Rome) - Return to Rome via van to Naples then train to Rome. If we're not too tired, see Santo Stefano Rotundo and Temple of Hadrian. 

Day 13 (Rome) - Vespa tour (not everyone is excited about this)? Spa day if not too expensive? 

Day 14 - FLY HOME! ",t2_11gpua,First-timer! Does my itinerary suck?,1.0,9,1712846968.0,1712846968.0,43,spaghettieiffeltower,1c1gzkh
ItalyTravel,"Hi, everyone. I wanted to share my experience of visiting the northeasternmost region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, or 'Friuli' for brevity's sake.

For context, I am half-Italian by heritage. My father's family came to Canada in the early 1950s from Friuli. My grandmother was born and raised in Arzene outside of the city of Udine before immigrating to Canada at the age of four, while my grandfather grew up in the sub-division of Bagnarola in Sesto Al Reghena near the city of Pordenone. By blood, I am part-Friulian, so my ties to this region are strong.

In July of 2023, I travelled to Italy with my family, and maternal aunt's family, along with my paternal grandmother, making nine of us in total. We flew into Venice and stayed there for about two days before travelling up north. Venice was beautiful, although it was very crowded and screamed 'tourism'. It's a must-see for travelling, and I would go again

After, we drove for about an hour to the region of Friuli, first stopping in the commune of Sesto Al Reghena to meet extended family, and we had lunch at a lovely restaurant called *Ristoro e Alloggio*. There, we were treated to a more authentic Italian meal, with escargots, polenta, various cold cuts, and a traditional dish of the region called frico, which is similar to a frittata, and made with potatoes and cheese, usually montasio, and onions. 

Once lunch was done, they took us to a monastery in Sesto Al Reghena, near the home of my grandfather, called the *Abbazia di Santa Maria in Silvis*, which had been built since around 735 C.E. Perhaps one of my favourite parts of this trip, for the monastery contained insurmountable history that shocked me. The vestibule had decor of paintings inspired by *Dante's Inferno*, with a painting of Lucifer in Inferno that shook me to my core. Outside of the monastery, I saw a peacock for the first time in the wild, and it was beautiful. The water in the area flowing under the bridge to cross to the monastery was so clean, that you could see the vegetation underneath like it was glass, and the area was so green and vibrant. Once we were done, our cousins led us to their place for refreshments and some information about the region and our family history. 

What caught my eye was a fountain of water running cold, clean water continuously. Our cousins explained that the water was free, and the only fee to pay was to have a hole drilled in their backyard to set up the fountain. It was the cleanest water I have ever drank, and it came from the Dolomite mountain range up north. Little details like that gave me a more fulfilling feeling of visiting the country and the stark contrast of life in Canada.

From there, after saying our thanks and goodbyes, we stayed at a B&B in Udine, for about two more days. The next morning, we drove to Stadio Friuli, the home ground for Serie A club Udinese Calcio, my favourite Seria A club. I bought a home kit, along with a scarf and a Udinese Calcio football. In the distance, you can see the Dolomites, and near the stadium there was a dip in the area, creating a valley. And, nearby where we stood was a palm tree. It was the only time I had ever seen mountains, a valley, and palm trees in one setting, and it was unique.

That same day we went to see my grandmother's relatives, whom she hadn't seen in around seventy years, in the commune of Arzene. Luckily for us, my grandmother still speaks the Italian and Friulian languages, the latter a bit more proficient, so that saved us much hassle for communication. It was slightly different than Sesto Al Reghena, for while the latter had access to the river Tagliamento, Arzene was more dry, yet still tightly connected. Our visit lasted around three hours, and we were fed homemade frico, without onions, and drank various liquors until driving back to the B&B.

The next morning, my cousin and I went to the piazza, and I believe Udine is my favourite city in Italy that I have been to. It was not crowded, it was clean, it was quiet and walkable, feeling more like Italy and less like a tourist attraction. I bought some books about Friuli and the Friulian language at a lovely bookstore and had a delicious caffè shakerato with a chocolate croissant for breakfast. Udine is a good-sized city, that is neither loud nor hectic and harbours much history with various amounts of commodities. I highly recommend visiting to Udine if you want to take it easy while on your trip to Italy, if not just to see it. 

Afterwards, we made our final Friulian stop at San Daniele del Friuli, the home of prosciutto. Driving there was a fun experience, seeing palm trees, and mountains, and driving up and down various rises from being so close to the mountains, the landscape was very hilly. Now, I find prosciutto to be very salty, but this prosciutto was AMAZING. It was also very rich, so I could not eat all that was given to us for the tour. Then, we were off to Tuscany to spend a few days in a villa in a town called Terriciola.

To summarize, Friuli was amazing. It felt like a very authentic experience of Italy, devoid of tourists and gimmicks. The food was perfect, the atmosphere was calm and the cities were very developed. It was walkable, and the scenery was incredible. I would spend a week in the region if I could.

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m travelling with my girlfriend in a few days in Milan. To be more specific, we’re gonna stay 4 nights in this city.

We have already booked a hotel to stay, I was wondering if you could give us some advice about the following:

1) what is a must to visit 

2) some good restaurants where we get to taste some traditional food

3) what means of transport should we use more often 

4) where is the best place for shopping 

5) some areas with nice nightlife 

And finally, what should we avoid, mostly the high crime areas and genuinely whatever you think is worth mentioning 

Feel free to share with us your experiences visiting this beautiful city.

ItalyTravel,"Hi everyone ,

Just curious on your thoughts regarding reservations (mostly for restaurants) in Italy. As I've continued with my planning, I have made several reservations for dinner and bought tickets in advance for popular sites. However I am wondering how ""possible"" it is to have dinner at a quality spot in places like Rome and Florence without a reservation. I would love to have a night here and there where my husband and I walk around the city and choose a restaurant based on the vibe we get. 

Also for a moment I would like to ask about Tuscany in specific - Are there places, whether restaurant or otherwise, that reservations/advanced tickets are necessary? It seems more like an area to wander and explore but I just want to make sure I am not missing anything.

Additional info in case it's useful: We are a married couple in our 30s going to Italy for the first time ever. We are big foodies. Budget is pretty high though we're not trying to throw away money for no reason. Our current plan is: Rome -> Naples -> Sorrento (we'll do Pompeii and the coasts from here) -> Florence -> Tuscany -> depart from Rome.

ItalyTravel,"I apologize for what seems like a very basic question, I read through the search results but could not be certain of my answer since the Skip the Line seems to be from advance tickets and tours bought through tour companies.   


If I buy the official tickets from the official Vatican website, are those automatically ""Skip the Line"" tickets? Will we just need to queue up to pick up our tickets then go through security and enter?   
I have heard you only get 15 minutes in the Sistine Chapel and that later in the day near closing time can be better. Can we explore the museums, get an aperitivo at the Pinecone (buy the happy hour tickets?) and come back? The Vatican site says, ""Enjoy a delicious Happy Hour in the enchanting Pinecone Courtyard. The admission ticket is valid only for the issue date and cannot be used twice. Visitors will not be permitted to re-enter the Vatican Museums if they leave the premises before the starting time of the Happy Hour. The Happy Hour will not be refunded."" So does that mean that as long as we wait until after Happy Hour starts we can re-enter the museums? We are not morning people so a later entry will be better for us, and we have the possibility of Friday or Saturday night-- is there a better time between those two?   


If we do the guided tour for individuals, can we remain in the museums and explore more after the tour is done? Two hours seems short but then again there is only so much one can absorb in such a historical place, so perhaps that would be enough? But I would like to see the Egyptian Rooms. 

Conversely, can one go first to the Sistine Chapel and then explore the museums?   


And one more question, it seems to enter the dome of the Basilica requires a separate ticket. When I am looking through the ticket options for booking the museums and Sistine Chapel, I'm not seeing an option to add on the dome. Do I need to do that on the day?

My only concern is my safety.  I travelled alone to Athens but it was almost 30 years ago and I never felt unsafe.  But I will 60 and the world has changed.  

Any comments, concerns, observations?  Much appreciated.

ItalyTravel,"Hi!

My husband and I are currently planning our honeymoon and will be spending a week in the Tuscan region. I have done a lot of research on what areas to visit but there are so many options--it's becoming a bit overwhelming!

We mostly want the country side Italian experience-- spending time eating food, drinking wine and just immersing ourselves into the Italian culture. Some beach time would be nice if possible (not finding a ton of information on beaches in the region) but not necessary!

We obviously want to see Florence, but I don't think we want to spend more than 2 days there.  I found a really cute villa in Montepulciano -- so I was thinking we could stay there a few days and take day trips to some of the other nearby towns. Some of the towns I have on my list are : Pienza, Cortona, San Gimagnano, Siena, and Orvieto.

I would really love to know what towns people loved and how much time we need for each location-- day trip? or overnight stay?

ItalyTravel,"*Arrival and Travel:* Arrived at Linate Airport and took a taxi to Milano Centrale, followed by a train to Verona (booked on trenitalia, get the app for real time updates). Taxis were easy to use, affordable, and the drivers were very helpful with luggage (also they seemed to love kids which was cool). Uber was also available, a few bucks more usually. We accidentally boarded a local train, which offered a glimpse into local commuter life but took longer than expected.  Vaporettos were easy in Venice once you get down where to stand and what line to take, but if you can budget it and are staying close to canal, the water taxis might be worth the $ in retrospect, carrying luggage up stairs not ideal  

*Verona Highlights:* Verona was a highlight of the trip, with charming salami and cheese stores, wine shops, and a craft beer bar steps from where we were staying. We dined at Pizzeria da Salvatore and Trattoria Al Pompiere (Ravioli di faraona della Lessinia con fondo d'arrosto, pecorino riserva e € 20 BEST BITE ALL WEEK), both great service and accommodating to kids. We explored the Torre dei Lamberti, Castelvecchio Museum, Piazza Bra and took the Funicolare di Castel San Pietro for beautiful views.

*Venice Highlights:* In Venice, we experienced a iconic gondola ride along the canals and visited the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Doge's Palace, St. Mark’s Basilica, and took many rides on the vaporettos to get to our destinations. (I got the 3 day pass which i thought was a decent deal) We also attended a Venezia FC match (lost to parma 1-2) which was very memorable, my kids loved it.  Mostly just walked around and explored, our Airbnb was also right on the grand canal which was incredible.  Glad I read a Venice history book before, felt like i was in 1300s at times.  Dinner spots included Trattoria ai Cugnai dal 1911 (twice!), Al Covo, and a great sandwich shop, L’ Bacaro de’ Bischeri.  Also stopped randomly for chichetti and wine from 5-8 each night when a place looked good. 

*Milan Highlights:* In Milan for a afternoon to be close to airport, we visited the Last Supper (booked tickets at 5am when they went on sale, cool experience you get to view the masterpiece for 15 minutes with a group of about 15) and took the lift up to the Duomo terraces for stunning views. The Metro (subway) was convenient and easy to navigate. Dinner at Bice was a memorable end to the trip.

  
tips: make sure to carry cash, at the soccer match i got a good natured 'in Italy we use cash' for holding up the beer line...everyone was very nice and helpful but totally different than attending nfl, mlb or soccer matches at home.  Venice was a dream, only parts I found overcrowded were st marks and the areas right around there, perfect early november weather all trip. ate mozzarella at every stop, drank lots of vino, peronis, negronis and birra moretti... loved my first trip to italy, this sub huge help, can't wait to go back, Rome next time!

I realize some of the towns we are staying in are big tourism hot spots, but to say there’s no good food was surprising.

ItalyTravel,"I am writing this a few months after my trip, when I was there in August. I wanted to write because I was somewhat worried before traveling. We visited about 6-7 different cities and enjoyed every one. Before talking about safety, it is only fair to give the context that my friend and I are in our mid-twenties and we are both 6'2 and have full beards. I don't know if that we the reason, but we had no problems with being concerned about being pickpocketed. I carried a cross-body bag on my chest and never did I fear that someone would take my bag. In the busier areas I would just place my hand over the bag just in case.

Also, another point was carrying passports. We stayed at many hotels and AirBnBs and we left our passports behind basically every time. The only time we had to show identification was at the Colosseum and that is it. I'm not sure if an image of an ID would work there, but I would assume so because we later went to a football match and we showed an image of our ID there. We were not asked to show ID by the police like I saw other people talking about.

For transportation, we used the trains to get around. It was very easy to book trains on the Trenitalia app. I booked our trains a day ahead just to be safe, but there were a few occasions where we did the day of with no problem. We also used the bus a couple times which was simple as tickets could be purchased at the tobacco stores or even with tap to pay on the busses we were on. In general, every place we went to had tap to pay and took cards. We exchanged a bit too much cash in my opinion, but it didn't hurt to have extra.

We traveled around with carry-on luggage only and I kept an extra backpack in mine to hold the items we purchased while there. Traveling with normal luggage isn't impossible, but makes it much more awkward and difficult. 

  
There were a few occasions where we were travelling between cities and we would simply leave our luggage at storage lockers. There was always one very close to the train stations at all the cities we went to.

I made this post more to answer any questions people had regarding logistics or safety or anything like that.

Our trip went very smoothly with minimal hiccups so I'm happy to help out.

P.S. all of the restaurants we ate at with amazing food were recommended by locals and people working at the hotels, neither of the places we went to that we saw on instagram were amazing, not bad but not all that.",t2_me6fv25oq,Safety and Trip Across Italy,0.74,7,1730156384.0,1730156384.0,5,Puzzleheaded-Hair827,1gefuy6

ItalyTravel,"We had a fabulous 15 days in Italy.  We bookended the trip with Krakow and Amsterdam so the unique Italian delights were even more highlighted- especially the food!  

We loved Florence - first time.  Hotel Accademia was a great value and close to all the action.  Dinner at Antica Trattoria “da Tito” was a highlight.  City was packed which did surprise us for October. Did the Walkabout Tuscany tour and it was rushed - but without a car, it would be difficult to see all those attractions, so it was a necessary evil for us. 

Cinque Terre, also first time, was beautiful and we enjoyed traveling between the villages.  We are not hikers so the frequent and quick train rides were fine.  Hotel La Spiaggia in Monterosso was excellent and a quick walk from the train station. We had planned on eating at several different restaurants but our lunch at La Cantina Di Miky was so good that we ate there two more times!  Weather was crappy but we made the best of it.

Milan just knocked our socks off.  Hotel Cusani Milano was a little pricey but perfectly located and the service and food were first rate. The Duomo and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele were breathtaking.  The city was so vibrant and full of music and so much to do and see.  The nightlife was incredible.  One of our best meals, and I am stunned to say this, was at the Galleria Cafe.  Risotto Milanese and Osso Buco were perfect. We received two amuse bouches and a second desert and a complimentary glass of Amaro.  The service was perfect.  I know it’s a tourist trap, but it delivered. 

We ended up in Venice and it is our favorite place which we have been fortunate to visit several times.  Hotel Campiello was serviceable with a good breakfast and zero bridges to cross from the Vaporetto stop.  We ate dinner at Osteria di Santa Marina and it was top shelf.  We also ate at our favorite - Alle Testiere and it is money every time. The warmth of Luca and the cooking of Bruno just must be experienced.

All of the major sights in the cities lived up to expectations.  We were not previously experienced train travelers and we learned a lot through trial and error, mostly error!  We had tons of luggage, but with the amount of things we purchase for ourselves and others , it is hard to avoid.  After all, we may never be back and things bought at special times and places warm the heart moving forward.

ItalyTravel,"Hey all, first off want to say thanks to all who contribute here. This sub has been pretty informative for me as I plan our first trip to Italy. 

We're aiming to go late Feb or early  March(booking tickets/lodging next week) and would love some feedback from those who have experience on how this trip sounds. We normally are not into the regimented travel and usually just roam and explore.but it seems unavoidable if we want to see the main stuff unfortunately. So yeah,  this is what I've come up with.

Day 1: arrive in Rome around 2pm from our 15hr flight from west coast usa.check in, relax, go out to dinner, sleep and adjust to new timezone. We're looking to lodge near piazza novona/pantheon.

Day 2:  head out on foot and explore the area as we go and see the navona, pantheon, trevi fountain, and the spanish steps. Stops for food along the way. 

Day 3: take a bus or cab to the colosseum and underground. Followed by arch, forum, capitoline hill and its museums, and then trajans column as we finish up the day and head back for some dinner.

Day 4: head out on foot to the Jewish ghetto, stopping to see the theatre, the two temples across the river, along with the Curia of Pompey and the market otw back to our lodging. Basically a free roaming day of one area we have lots of interest in.

Day 5: vatican museum. Food and that's it. Keep hearing this is a say unto itself so heeding advice.  

Day 6: we're hoping to secure necropolis access under st peters(waiting to hear back now) but if we do get in, this+ st peters, along with the Castel and its bridge our the only goals for the day.

Day 7: we're either doing one of the tour bus groups or training down to pompeii. Would love to squeeze the museum in Naples in, bit that seems pretty tight? Back to Rome for the night.

Day 8: train time to venice first thing in the morning. Arrive in venice, get settled by what seems like 1-2pm and go explore with no real plans(yippie!)

Day 9:  checking out the main stuff, doge, st marks, rialto bridge,bridge of sighs, gondola rides, etc. And then just roaming around and see where it takes us.

Day 10: check out, hop on a flight out of Venice back to UK or Ireland and then back home to west coast usa.

On top of these, we have a handful of things we will try to squeeze in. But aren't married to em. Piazza Giovanni and the obelisk, the appian way park, and the borghese museum/park. We're thinking of adding an extra day to make some of these work or just make the trip less rushed. But 10 is about our limit for this trip.

So how's this sounding to the brain trust? Are we trying to cram in too much? Does it sound about right? I feel like it's on the higher side of acceptable from my research.

ItalyTravel,"I returned from my trip to Italy last Sunday and wanted to write a little trip report so you can see if your itinerary is too full or if it is doable. I visited from Austria, first staying where my family lives (Alto Adige) and i did a day trip to Gardaland before traveling south. I traveled with my gf, we are 26-28 y/o and I am not particularly fit (my feet hurt a lot by the end of this week).

I studied art history so my main reason for travelling was seeing the churches and sights I learned about in school. I am also a very picky eater and my gf is a vegetarian, so you will not really find many food-recs in here as we ate a lot of panini, snacks and arancini to get through the day as cheaply as possible.

# Saturday 14.9. - Day 1 - Naples (20k steps)

Our flight from Verona to Naples was on time, although the airport in Verona is currently under construction and it was all very crowded and unsystematic. When we arrived in Naples, it was super easy buying a ticket for the airport shuttle. It was very crowded tho so we had to wait for the 3rd shuttle to come to finally be able to board it. We arrived at our accommodation at the port (B&B Il Porto) just in time to check in. We are frugal travellers so we don't care about getting fancy accomodation, it had everything we needed and they cleaned it every day (brought free water too). They gave us vouchers so we could get something to eat for breakfast every morning at the bar next to the B&B. The only weird thing we have never seen was the fact that the elevator only works when you put in 10 cents during specific times.

The rest of the day we explored Naples - first stop was Antica Pizza fritta da zia Esterina, which had amazing fried pizza for 4,90€ (craving it so bad rn) but also a huge line waiting outside. After, we went to the Neptune fountain and saw some rather disturbing things (a what seemed to be teenage couple REALLY going at it in front of playing children, police and elderly people, no one seemed to care - we saw the same people the next day doing it at the same spot again. Ew.)

After witnessing that, we walked up to Castel Sant'Elmo and then took the way down without looking at Google Maps, seeing the Spaccanapoli and kinda having a culture shock lol. Honestly, I loved Naples, but at the end of the day I was pretty tired from all loud noises, sellers and almost getting run over all the time.

# Sunday 15.9. -  Day 2 - Capri (22k steps)

Today we went to Capri. We bought the ferry tickets the evening before - the ferry at 8:50 was sold out, so we got the later one. When we arrived we first did a boat tour (23€) around the island, except the waves were too bad so we could not see the other side of the island. We returned the same way we came from after the Faraglioni. After that, we walked up all the steps to the city center. We weren't aware there was a funicular we could have taken LMAO. The weather was amazing, not a single cloud. I got sunburnt bad. First thing we did was get ice cream at Buonocore (4€). Then we walked to the natural arch viewpoint. We spent some time there as we were really tired and the heat was relentless. It was around 2pm at this point.

We then walked back and decided to go to Villa Lysis. The walk was beautiful and barely any people were around, just a lot of cats. I was missing free water fountains, tho. The Villa was absolutely stunning and there were also some cats roaming around. Entry costs 2,5€. My girlfriend then proposed to me on the rooftop! It was truly unforgettable. It gave me the morale boost I needed to walk all the way back (quickly, because our ferry was departing at around 6pm). We were there enough time in advance and got a slushy (5€) at the port. Taking the ferry back was a nightmare. People were lining up and pushing left and right, it was really bad. I thought we were going to get crushed. When we got back to Naples we ate pizza at Gusto Marigliano - the waiters were very nice and they spoke several languages fluently. The pizza was great (i had the funghi e cotto one).

I honestly totally misplanned this day, I had planned to see more things (villa jovis, parco astarita, monte solaro chairlift), but I am glad we took it relatively easy, as this was the best day of the trip. I especially liked looking at all the ceramic tiles on the houses there.

# Monday 16.9. - Day 3 - Positano/Amalfi (14k steps)

Today we wanted to get up early to catch the first ferry tour by NLG (Naples-Positano-Amalfi), but we were extremely tired so we only got the ferry at 10:20. We arrived in Positano around half an hour too late, so we only had around an hour there before having to head back to the port. This was a bummer, as I really liked it. So we walked up the Via Cristoforo Colombo street until we found a good spot to take a picture of the cliff, then headed back. Really tempted to buy something lemon themed, but too expensive.

When we arrived in Amalfi i was a little underwhelmed, tbh. The duomo was pretty, but i thought positano was way prettier (my fiancé disagrees, she likes Amalfi more). We had around 3,5 hours here. We spent it exploring the streets and then walked to Atrani, but didn't have enough time to enter the city. We regretted not taking a change of socks and/or our bikinis, as the beach looked very appealing but we unfortunately spent too much time in Amalfi instead of directly going to the beach in Atrani. Boarding the ferry wasn't bad this time, just made the mistake of sitting right in front and i felt kind of sick in the end there (every wave felt like a huge jump).

# Tuesday 17.9. - Day 4 - Pompeii (24k steps)

By far the worst day of the trip because of the weather. We woke up relatively late again and walked to the train station, where we got the Circumvesuviana. It was packed and uncomfortable. First we ate lunch at ""La Cantina di Plinio"" where we were the only customers. I got a decent Carbonara and she got Aglio e Olio.

When we got to Pompeii, we bought 2 Audio guides for 10€ each - already felt kinda scammed here, as I read online they cost 7€. They were an old phone with a GPS tracker and a British guy talking very slowly about the sights. They didn't provide us with headphones, so we couldn't really use them at the same time. Then it immediately started to pour, and we were stuck under a rock trying not to get wet (our umbrellas couldn't handle the amount of water). Meanwhile, the entire park was underwater, you could not avoid walking without stepping into deep water. We then didn't use the audio guides since we were soaked and didn't want to risk damaging them.

It stopped pouring at around 5, so we looked around a bit more (we could barely walk at this point) and then we returned home. Our shoes and feet were so disgusting because of all the water, we had to hang the shoes outside our window for the remainder of the trip so we wouldn't smell them lmao

# Wednesday 18.9. - Day 5 - Rome (24k steps)

Our train to Rome left at 9:35 and we got there on time at 11. We took the metro to our next b&b, ""Allegras House Caracciolo"" and left our luggage there. The stay there was very disappointing, but it would get way too long if I talked about all the things that went wrong there. We then walked all the way across the city, stopping for supplí at ""Supplizio"" (3€ each, by far the best food on the trip) before seeing all of these sights: Chiesa dell'Orazione e Morte, Fontana delle Tartarughe, Largo di Torre Argentina, Sant'Ignazio di Loyola, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon (AMAZING!!!!), Il Gesú (stunning), Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, and lastly Piazza Navona (sadly the fountains were all under construction). Then we took the bus back to our b&b and got some focaccia at carrefour. It was a long day but I saw sooo many things I was looking forward to for the last almost 10 years!

# Thursday 19.9. - Day 6 - Rome (17k steps)

Today we went to the Vatican first thing in the morning and stood in line to enter the Basilica for exactly an hour. After looking at the inside (I am not at all religious, but I got goosebumps while entering) we queued for to enter the dome for another 45 minutes. Turns out EVERYONE takes the elevator lol. Thank god we did, I was about to meet god while climbing the steps. The view was worth it, but the extremely narrow winding staircase was ab absolute nightmare!

We spent around 4,5 hours in and around the basilica. We then got something to eat at carrefour and queued for the Museum, which we had a ticket for 4:30. Going inside was stressful but I imagined the crowds to be worse inside. It was actually fine. My favorite thing inside was the map room (I even found my small hometown on there twice!). We were absolutely wrecked after queueing several hours this day, so we fell asleep like a rock.

# Friday 20.9. - Last day - Rome (28k steps)

What we thought would be the chillest day actually turned out to be the one with the longest walking lol.

We had to get up early because of the train/bus strike, as we had 9:00 colosseum tickets. We unfortunately didn't get any ""special"" tickets as they were immediately sold out. The thing that stuck with me the most was the roman peach pits they found. I thought those were biodegradable lol

We were very tired so we took it easy, walked around the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, then walked all the way to the Spanish Steps and back to our b&b. We then got some food at ""La cantina di Cesare"". This is where I ate the worst 15€ Carbonara I ever had - it was basically scrambled eggs. My fiancé even found plastic wrap in her pasta. I usually don't ever complain when I go somewhere as I am very shy, but I told the owner about the plastic, and he actually gave us 7€ off our check. It was a nice gesture, but the way he explained it sounded more like he wanted to buy our silence OR he didn't want me to accept his offer (his answers to bad reviews on Google are weird).

Some things we couldn't fit into this day: Bocca della Veritá, Museum and Crypts of the Capuchin Friars, San Pietro in Vincoli. We took the train home the next day at 7:35.

Overall, this vacation was all I ever wanted (tried organizing it since 2020 but then covid and life happened). I will definitely be back to see the things i missed, I especially want to explore Naples more and see Pompeii again! I have never felt unsafe in regards of robberies and honestly, I imagined Naples to be waaaay dirtier than it actually was according to what everyone around me kept telling me ever since I was a kid.

On Saturday, September 7th, 2024 my luggage was stolen on the bus from Venice to the airport. Imagine all of your favorite clothes, gone! Luckily I had our passports and cash onhand. I discovered this when we arrived to the airport, and had to either cancel my flight, figure out work and accomodations, and then go back to Venice to file a report, or submit an insurance claim when I arrived back home. I chose to submit a claim when I was returning home.

The insurance process is going OK, but they are asking me to file a report to the police for the report number. All of my google searches aren't returning anything.

There is this, [https://www.poliziadistato.it/scrivici/message](https://www.poliziadistato.it/scrivici/message), which I sent a message to, but not sure if this is appropriate. I have also called local venice stations and will be calling them again tomorrow in their 4 hour open window (really!?).

How can I file a police report for stolen items after I leave Italy? Any help would be much appreciated.

Update:

1 month later, insurance has approved my claim. I made sure to keep track of all my attempts to contact the venice police, the italian police, the emails that I sent, everthing.

ItalyTravel,"I wanted to share my experience searching for souvenir espresso cups on a recent vacation in Italy because before I went I found a few legacy Reddit posts but I felt the suggestions weren't the best. 

First, I was looking for a classic white espresso cup. The thick wall ones that you get in tons of bars (Italian coffee shops) across the country. They usually preheat them so they hold the espresso temperature while you are standing at the bar drinking it.  

I ended up buying some at two coffee bars that also sold their cups. In Florence, I went to [Ditta Artigianale](https://www.dittaartigianale.it/)  and in Venice [Caffè del Doge](https://www.caffedeldoge.com/). These are just two of many places I am sure you could probably look at, but I liked them because both places have excellent coffee, are close to the touristy areas and sell the cups in their shop. They are branded cups, but I wanted that look. Plus I really like the graphics on the Ditta Artigianale ones and the Caffè del Doge is pretty minimal. 

So here is what I learned:  

* They might have limited stock, so be ready to visit more than one location if you are looking for a set. They also have a few sizes but the largest is going to be a cappuccino size. 
* Not all coffee bars in Italy sell their cups (for obvious reasons - it's not what they are trying to make money at). I went to [Farini ](https://farini.com/)in Venice and really liked their coffee and cups (but they don't sell them). They also looked at me funny when I asked. 
* Souvenir shops typically DO NOT sell great espresso cups. Most of the ones I found were covered in images of tourist attractions, but more importantly, were thin-walled and not the same classic-style you get in the bars. 
* Speaking of which, both the cups I bought in Ditta Artigianale and Caffè del Doge were made by [Club House](https://www.clubhouse.ch/), which is an Italian wholesale supplier that offers branded cups. I only discovered this when I got home and flipped over the cup to find their logo on the bottom. I would be curious how many coffee bars use them as a supplier. 
* I didn't look in kitchen stores or similar as I liked the idea of branded ones. But probably also worth looking in, but harder to find if you are sticking to the tourist areas. 
* Some people suggested Bialetti which does have some nice cups (especially ones that have Italian colours or graphic designs on them), but typically also has their logo with that. It just wasn't what I was looking for. 

In conclusion, I would totally recommend it if you are a coffee lover and want to bring home a little bit of Italy to enjoy at home every morning.  ",t2_6cwigtfv,Buying espresso cups as souvenir in Italy,0.9,8,1721062890.0,1721062890.0,9,KBinCanada,1e3zzj7

ItalyTravel,"Salve ragazzi,

I‘m back from my Italytrip and I want to share my experience!

It was our second trip to Italy, two years ago we traveled to the Tuscany incl. Florence, Parma, Lucca and Cinque Terre.

This year we traveld to Sabaudia right in the middle between Rome and Napoli, so we visited Rome, Napoli and some smaller cities like Sperlonga, Gaeta and Terracina.

The first two days we visited Rome and yes it‘s full of tourists but absolutely beautiful! The architecture is so unique that you probably won't find it anywhere else! 
What bothered me a bit is that everything is incredibly full and almost everything you want to visit is really really expensive. You need a loooot of time if you want to visit everything and you need good shoes, because you have to walk a lot and the walkways are sometimes very rough and difficult to walk. 

We visited Naples for the next two days and this is the most blatant contrast you can imagine! Naples and Rome are two completely different worlds, Naples is much more chaotic and louder, but somehow also more honest and authentic, I can't explain it properly.
In Naples, everything is a little closer together, you don't have to walk quite as much to see and experience and enjoy as much as possible. The food is an absolute force compared to Rome, we ate a lot and everything tasted better than in Rome and was also significantly cheaper.

I read a lot about sperlonga in advance, but I personally find that completely overhyped, it's just a small tourist city with a great view of the sea, but we found Gaeta beautiful, it has a great promenade and a sweet old town.

If you want to go to the sea, it is definitely worth comparing the prices for the loungers and umbrellas!
We asked a lot of ""Lidos"" and received offers from 60€ to 15€ for a full day at the sea.

We mostly travaled by train to the big cities and we really liked it, it's incredibly cheap and very easy and reliable!

We went to the smaller cities by rental car, which was also easy and unproblematic once you got used to the driving style of the Italians ( No blinker and overtake even in the narrowest places )

Overall, we really enjoyed our trip and now I wish every future Italian vacationer a nice time!",t2_8i701chk,Holiday Report!,0.74,7,1720257687.0,1720257687.0,10,Ideal_beer,1dwlo5m

If we just walk on public streets around the Colosseum and Forum area will we be able to see anything?  Obviously it won’t compare to actually getting inside, but are their views from outside?  I know there are views of the Colosseum because I’ve seen pictures on google but I can’t tell if we’ll be able to see anything in the archaeological area from the street.

ItalyTravel,"Ciao! My parents (late 60s) are interested in going to Italy, and I am planning a \~2 week trip for them. It will be their second time there (they have already been to Roma, Pisa, Firenze, and Venezia). They are pretty active/fit, but only for walking within cities/towns (probably not any hiking). They love towns/small cities, architecture, good food, hills/mountains, and the sea. They are open to anywhere in Italy.

My parents don't want to join a tour. Therefore, I think it is best if they stayed in one place, and took day trips.

Are there are small cities (less than 400,000 people) with good Trenitalia connectivity to small, historical towns that are safe for seniors? For example, from Bari it is possible to visit Matera or Alberobello with one bus or train. Or, from Bologna it is possible to visit Parma or Ferrara on Trenitalia.

ItalyTravel,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning a trip from Naples to visit the Pompeii excavations and Mount Vesuvius and would love some advice. I’ve been looking at various websites, but I find the information confusing.

My main questions are:

1. Can I buy train tickets in advance to travel from Naples (preferably Napoli Centrale) to Pompeii? I would prefer to book in advance if possible unless this is not recommended. I would also love for this to be roundtrip if possible. I searched in Trenitalia, but they have no direct trains, but with 2 stops making the whole trip way longer.

Additionally, if anyone has tips on the best way to get from Pompeii to Mount Vesuvius, that would be great!

Should we add another city to this list? My husband is into history and we both love exploring. We have both been to Venice so that’s not on our list. I once drove through the Portofino area and stopped to have lunch up in the hills and thought it was amazingly beautiful. Is it worth heading up there for a couple days or is Amalfi Coast area just as nice?

For the Amalfi Coast, where is the best place to stay? Our idea for this portion of the trip is a small hotel or apartment where we can easily walk to grab a cup of coffee or wine and sit on a patio near the water and people watch or just relax. Medium price range.

I've been looking at crash courses (for a lack of better words) in manual shifting just in case something goes wrong and all they have is stick, but obviously I'd rather save my money in light of how much I'll be spending on this godforsaken vacation lol.

1. There's only one person who owns all the tabacchis in Rome. He goes from location to location and opens the shop for 1-2 minutes. This is his hell loop.
2. The tabacchi only opens the shop when he's out of cigarettes at home. Whenever he's out of cigarettes, he goes to the shop to get some for himself and serves the customers who happen to arrive at that time.

ItalyTravel,"Hi all, i (m, 40) will be travelling solo to Lake Garda in September, for 7 nights (no car).

I asked this question on tripadvisor and all 5 diferrent responders suggested either Garda or Bardolino for a first time visitor with the above circumstance, so that’s where i’ve been looking so far, i guess i’m asking if that would be a good call given all the info?

My flights are booked and paid for, my hotel (in Garda) is reserved with the option to cancel, which is likely as i can afford more than i initially thought so currently looking still in those areas, some nightlife would be good, even if it’s just a few bars/restaurants, or a nice place to walk the streets as the day comes to a close

I haven’t got into the full planning for itinerary yet but some things i like the look of so far;

Cable car up to Monte Baldo, someone suggested making a day of it, travelling up there, doing the experience and making my way back by ferry later on, which sounds nice
A vineyard tour

After entering the museum, we immediately got a message from the driver that someone broke the tiny window next to the side mirror and opened the car door and all the bags were gone.

Nothing happened to me when I was in Milano last year, but unfortunately got robbed this time. 

Luckily there was not much cash and valuables inside, so I guess it is a tripe lose situation - driver, the thieves and us.
