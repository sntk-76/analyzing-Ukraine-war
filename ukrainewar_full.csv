This megathread is meant for discussion of the current **Russo-Ukrainian War**, also known as the **Russian invasion of Ukraine**. Please read our [current rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules), but also the extended rules below.

# News sources:

- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance)

- [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine).

- [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60525350)

- [Al Jazeera English](https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/)

You can also get up-to-date information and news from the [r/worldnews live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs), which are more up-to-date tweets about the situation.

### **Current rules extension:**
 
Extended [r/europe ruleset](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules) to curb hate speech and disinformation:

- While we already ban hate speech, we'll remind you that hate speech against the civilians of the combatants is against our rules, including but not limited to Ukrainians, **Russians**, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc. The same applies to the population of countries actively helping Ukraine or Russia.

- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply. 

- **No unverified reports of any kind in the comments or in submissions on r/europe**. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.

- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.

- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.

### Submission rules

These are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.
	
- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. ""City X still holding"" would not be allowed, ""Russia takes major city"" would be allowed. ""Major attack on Kherson repelled"" would also be allowed.)

- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.
  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.
    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.
- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them. If your link has been removed, please notify the moderation team, explaining who's the person managing that substack page.
- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.
- No promotion of a new cryptocurrency or web3 project, other than the official Bitcoin and ETH addresses from Ukraine's government.

8,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

12,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

* Doomsday Clock - Wikipedia: [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday\_Clock](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

14,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

[https://lostarmour.info/articles/proizvodstvo-art-ukra-i-evrop](https://lostarmour.info/articles/proizvodstvo-art-ukra-i-evrop)  
  
üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

94,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

105,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.

The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

109,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

111,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

**1.** **ISRAEL ‚Äì HAMAS WAR** As the UN requests for immediate international action to end hospital attacks and with the talk of ‚Äúwar crimes‚Äù over Israel's hospital bombing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is damned if he continues with this highly aggressive stance toward Hamas and damned if he doesn't.¬†[Learn More with GEO Analysis direct to your inbox](https://follow.it/geopoliticalmatters) /‚Ä¶ #GEO\_Insights #Geopolitics¬†#Gaza #IsraelWarCrimes

**2. IRAN** ‚Äì The Gaza war could very easy escalate with various Iran-backed military factions weighing up when, not if, to directly assist Hamas amid the total onslaught by Israel. Ultimately Iran could determine how far the Israel-Hamas war spreads. Hezbollah has issued a ‚Äúfalse flag‚Äù statement indicating that the Shia military group was supportive of Hamas.¬†[Learn More with GEO Analysis direct to your inbox](https://follow.it/geopoliticalmatters) \#GEO\_Insights #Geopolitics¬† #HezbollahTerrorists¬†

191,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

### **Current rules extension:**
 
Extended [r/europe ruleset](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules) to curb hate speech and disinformation:

- While we already ban hate speech, we'll remind you that hate speech against the civilians of the combatants is against our rules, including but not limited to Ukrainians, **Russians**, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc. The same applies to the population of countries actively helping Ukraine or Russia.

- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply. 

- **No unverified reports of any kind in the comments or in submissions on r/europe**. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.

- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.

- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.

### Submission rules

These are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.
	
- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. ""City X still holding"" would not be allowed, ""Russia takes major city"" would be allowed. ""Major attack on Kherson repelled"" would also be allowed.)

- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.
  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.
    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.
- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them. If your link has been removed, please notify the moderation team, explaining who's the person managing that substack page.
- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.
- No promotion of a new cryptocurrency or web3 project, other than the official Bitcoin and ETH addresses from Ukraine's government.

202,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

206,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

* Doomsday Clock - Wikipedia: [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday\_Clock](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

208,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

288,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

### **Current rules extension:**
 
Extended [r/europe ruleset](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules) to curb hate speech and disinformation:

- While we already ban hate speech, we'll remind you that hate speech against the civilians of the combatants is against our rules, including but not limited to Ukrainians, **Russians**, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc. The same applies to the population of countries actively helping Ukraine or Russia.

- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply. 

- **No unverified reports of any kind in the comments or in submissions on r/europe**. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.

- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.

- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.

### Submission rules

These are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.
	
- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. ""City X still holding"" would not be allowed, ""Russia takes major city"" would be allowed. ""Major attack on Kherson repelled"" would also be allowed.)

- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.
  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.
    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.
- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them. If your link has been removed, please notify the moderation team, explaining who's the person managing that substack page.
- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.
- No promotion of a new cryptocurrency or web3 project, other than the official Bitcoin and ETH addresses from Ukraine's government.

299,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

303,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

305,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

385,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

396,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

400,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

* The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: [https://thebulletin.org/](https://thebulletin.org/)
* Current Time - 2023 - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: [https://thebulletin.org/](https://thebulletin.org/)
* Doomsday Clock - Wikipedia: [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday\_Clock](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

402,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

482,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

493,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

497,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

* Doomsday Clock - Wikipedia: [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday\_Clock](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

499,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

[https://lostarmour.info/articles/proizvodstvo-art-ukra-i-evrop](https://lostarmour.info/articles/proizvodstvo-art-ukra-i-evrop)  
  
üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

579,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

590,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

594,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

596,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

676,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

This megathread is meant for discussion of the current **Russo-Ukrainian War**, also known as the **Russian invasion of Ukraine**. Please read our [current rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules), but also the extended rules below.

# News sources:

- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance)

- [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine).

- [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60525350)

You can also get up-to-date information and news from the [r/worldnews live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs), which are more up-to-date tweets about the situation.

### **Current rules extension:**
 
Extended [r/europe ruleset](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules) to curb hate speech and disinformation:

- While we already ban hate speech, we'll remind you that hate speech against the civilians of the combatants is against our rules, including but not limited to Ukrainians, **Russians**, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc. The same applies to the population of countries actively helping Ukraine or Russia.

- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply. 

- **No unverified reports of any kind in the comments or in submissions on r/europe**. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.

- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.

- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.

### Submission rules

These are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.
	
- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. ""City X still holding"" would not be allowed, ""Russia takes major city"" would be allowed. ""Major attack on Kherson repelled"" would also be allowed.)

- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.
  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.
    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.
- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them. If your link has been removed, please notify the moderation team, explaining who's the person managing that substack page.
- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.
- No promotion of a new cryptocurrency or web3 project, other than the official Bitcoin and ETH addresses from Ukraine's government.

687,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

691,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

* The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: [https://thebulletin.org/](https://thebulletin.org/)
* Current Time - 2023 - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: [https://thebulletin.org/](https://thebulletin.org/)
* Doomsday Clock - Wikipedia: [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday\_Clock](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

693,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

773,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

784,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.

The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

788,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

790,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

870,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶

881,navalny,"Alexey Anatolyevich Navalny - my painting (by Anastasiia Asp). Putin killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny on February 16, 2024. He was 47 years old.

*Processing img ohx0bd3lg8tc1...*



Putin is a war criminal, a murderer, a torturer, he is much worse and more dangerous than Osama Bin Laden. I encourage you all to talk about this.



-



The death of Alexey Navalny made me very sad. And still, watching the video of February 15, where he is in prison unfairly, as he is innocent, I don‚Äôt understand how this is? Alexey Navalny had so much life and a huge amount of energy. He has fiery eyes and bright expressiveness. He seemed full of vitality. But he was killed.



On the other hand... What an enviable fate, indeed! To lead people. To stand under the guns of millions of eyes and call for a fight against a cruel tyrant, even when the fight seems meaningless and the goal is impossible; to call to fight for a beautiful, distant, fair idea. To be an oppositionist and a rebel. To be a legend and a leader, to carry the weight of your dazzling glory on your shoulders. To suffer and to die for this idea. Huge crowds flock to his grave. He is called a hero. Oh, this fate is sweeter than 90 years, or whatever, all 120 years of quiet, peaceful life! This is the life one dreams of in dreams, and this is the death! This is a life worth being called life, and a death worth itself! This is how it is worth living, and this is how it is worth dying! üí™



Vladimir Putin unjustly kept Alexey Navalny in prison under torture conditions for several years.

„Ö§

Vladimir Putin poisoned him with Novichok poison several years ago (Alexey Navalny survived then... not now).



And now Putin, who is most likely a psychopath, has killed Navalny.



And the person who recently breathed and felt is dead, and his heart no longer beats. Of course, to God, all are alive, so pray for the soul of Alexey Navalny.



At Navalny‚Äôs funeral on March 1, at least 16.5 thousand people gathered (this is the number of people who crossed the bridge in an hour and a half (not a whole day)), and maybe as many as 30 thousand people, and this despite the fact that there are brutal repressions in Russia, and these people were very scared. At Navalny‚Äôs funeral there was even a rally where people said ‚ÄúNo to war!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin is a murderer!‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkrainians are good people!‚Äù



Let me remind you: Putin is waging a criminal war against Ukraine and has already killed a lot of Ukrainian civilians, men, women and children, and killed many Ukrainian heroes defending their lands and their loved ones.

Putin also sent many Russian soldiers into the criminal war as cannon fodder, and a huge number of them are currently dead.



I think Europe and the United States should help Ukraine more. Putin will not stop, if he succeeds here, he will take over further, he will try to take over European countries or even start a war with the United States. Moreover, in Russia, besides Navalny, there are many other oppositionists and opposition leaders in prison, and they are also tortured and can be killed.

885,GeopoliticsGazette,"Hey, r/GeopoliticsGazette, another explosive week in global affairs, and the stakes are rising fast. Let‚Äôs break down the key events shaping the world right now:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Israel-Hezbollah Showdown**  
After a string of *exploding pager* attacks in Lebanon, Israel is gearing up for a potential full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. Iran could be dragged into the fray, and the region is inching closer to war. Is this the flashpoint that pulls the U.S. into a larger Middle East conflict? Thoughts?

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Gaza‚Äôs Unrelenting Humanitarian Crisis**  
While headlines focus on Israel‚Äôs northern front, Gaza is burning. A school bombing leaves 22 civilians dead, and ceasefire talks have collapsed. Israel‚Äôs strategy here seems clear‚Äîtotal domination, regardless of human cost. Where does this lead?

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine‚Äôs Strategic Missteps**  
Ukraine‚Äôs bold incursions into Kursk have backfired, giving Russia a stronger grip. As Russian forces advance toward Pokrovsk, Ukraine relies heavily on Western aid. With both military and economic support on the line, how long can Ukraine hold out?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Sri Lanka‚Äôs Pivotal Election**  
In Sri Lanka, post-economic collapse elections are in full swing. Anti-corruption candidates are gaining traction, but the old political dynasties still loom large. Could this election truly bring about change or more of the same?

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Modi‚Äôs U.S. Visit: Beyond Drones**  
PM Modi‚Äôs trip to the U.S. is making headlines for a multi-billion-dollar drone deal, but the real story is India embedding itself deeper in the U.S. supply chain. The Quad is watching China closely. Is India now America‚Äôs key ally in the Indo-Pacific?

üîç As always, these issues aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey affect global stability, trade, and diplomacy. Let‚Äôs hear your insights! Where do you see these conflicts going next? What ripple effects should we be watching for?

Bard's response to this Question: ""**Presently, what time is it on the Doomsday Clock?**""

As of today, Saturday, January 13, 2024, the Doomsday Clock stands at **90 seconds to midnight**. This is the closest it has ever been to midnight in its entire history, indicating a time of **unprecedented danger** according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The decision to move the clock closer to midnight in 2023 was primarily attributed to the heightened risks associated with the war in Ukraine, including the potential for nuclear escalation. Other factors contributing to the current setting include climate change, biological threats, and disinformation.

While the situation may seem bleak, it's important to remember that the Doomsday Clock is intended as a warning, not a prophecy. It reminds us of the grave threats we face, but also underscores the importance of taking action to address them. By working together and making positive choices, we can still move the clock back from the brink.

Here are some resources for further information:

* The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: [https://thebulletin.org/](https://thebulletin.org/)
* Current Time - 2023 - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: [https://thebulletin.org/](https://thebulletin.org/)
* Doomsday Clock - Wikipedia: [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday\_Clock](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

887,GeopoliticsGazette,"In August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region, surprising the world and sparking optimism in Western circles that this bold move could turn the tide of the war. Armed with U.S.-made weapons and seizing on initial gains, Kyiv hoped to stall Russia‚Äôs eastern advance by forcing Moscow to defend its own territory. But now, just weeks later, this gamble seems to have backfired.

While Russia briefly scrambled in Kursk, it quickly regrouped and unleashed a powerful offensive along Ukraine‚Äôs eastern front. Russian forces are now closing in on the key city of Prokrovsk, and the once-praised strategy is being criticized for leaving Ukraine‚Äôs defenses dangerously exposed. Could this ‚ÄúSecond Battle of Kursk‚Äù be the moment that tilts the war in Russia‚Äôs favor?

I‚Äôve just published an in-depth analysis exploring what went wrong, how this could shift the war‚Äôs momentum, and whether Ukraine's leadership might have sealed its fate with this miscalculated move.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Western leaders are facing a critical decision: should they follow the path of appeasement and allow Putin to retain parts of Ukraine, or stand firm and support Ukraine until full sovereignty is restored? History has taught us that appeasement rarely leads to lasting peace and often results in further aggression by authoritarian regimes.

In my latest article, I explore the lessons from WWII and how they apply to the choices facing Western politicians today.

üìä Production of shells in the EU: promises vs reality  
  
The EU significantly overestimates its capacity to produce 155mm shells.  
Actual production is about 500-600 thousand shells per year instead of the declared 1-1.7 million.  
Reasons for the lag: lack of raw materials, lack of long-term contracts, insufficient investments.  
  
üá∫üá¶ Supplies to Ukraine:  
  
1 million shells were promised per year, \~500 thousand were delivered.  
The Czech initiative has stalled: instead of 800 thousand, <50 thousand were delivered.  
  
üè≠ Production in Ukraine:  
  
The production of 155-mm NATO standard shells is being established.  
Negotiations are ongoing about a joint venture with Rheinmetall and others.  
The Ukrainian Armed Forces' need is 200 thousand shells per month.  
  
üá∑üá∫ For comparison: the Russian Federation produces 4-4.5 million shells per year (according to Western estimates)

967,Substack,"Hello, this is my Substack in which I attempt to bring a more digestible view on world events and right now the Ukrainewar in particular. I felt that propaganda is taking over public conversation and I believe in bringing a more objective perspective. I hope to inspire others to do the same.


Much has been said about the Russian-Ukrainian war (special military operation*), and none of it seems to clearly explain the intentions of the Russian Federation. We are to believe that the biggest country on the planet needs more land, or that Putin just wants his place in history next to Peter the Great. For many people who don‚Äôt have the time to pay attention to anything other than their jobs and families, those answers might do the trick, provided they don‚Äôt follow up with a simple Google search.

Ukraine is Ukraine

The name of the country in the Slavic language seems to be inspired by its placement on the map (if you see Russia as the center of the universe). Ukraine in Slavic seems to mean ‚Äúin the end‚Äù or ‚Äúat the end,‚Äù at the end of something big, at the end of the Russian Empire that spans across two continents where what are now considered countries were referred to as neighborhoods. To better explain it, I‚Äôll refer to a movie: when Captain America caught Peter Parker in a tight spot, he asked him, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù Spiderman answered, ‚ÄúQueens.‚Äù Then Captain America smiled and said, ‚ÄúBrooklyn.‚Äù Both were New Yorkers but from different neighborhoods. This is a very small example of the complexities of European lore. In the end, during the times of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was given a more respectable status that evolved into the creation of a nation with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Being at the end is not as it seems. For the Russian Empire, that seems to have looked at itself as the center of the universe, there are such concepts as ‚Äúat the end‚Äù for every European country, Ukraine will be the beginning. Both it and Belarus have served as the two doors that you have to push in order to enter into the ever-widening Russia. Again, for Europe, those countries are doors, but for Russia, they are gates‚Äîgates that have the power to stop every enemy just by existing. By not having such luxuries, China was forced to create the Great Wall of China to keep invaders at bay, and for the Russians, this is a completely different story. Invaders that were used to the conditions in Asia unlike their European neighbors.

Passive Bonuses

When you look at a map of the world and see Europe, the continent seems familiar. We feel like we know it, like it is something natural and home-like. We don‚Äôt seem to try and find anything weird in its shape or question its existence. It's there; it‚Äôs as old as all the rest of the land on Earth, and we still call it ‚Äúthe old continent.‚Äù When I look at the map and continue into Eastern Europe, the whole thing starts to look like a widening funnel. The funnel is something that is used to make the transfer of liquids easier or, depending on the size, to ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù certain objects into the desired space or container. Meaning that the way you use a funnel is by pouring things in the wide bit so that they come out from the narrow bit. In a sense, there is this natural warning when you are not using it correctly (in reverse). Yet leaders of world powers that had the same map that I have didn‚Äôt see what I see and have made serious attempts at using a funnel the wrong way with disastrous consequences. I hope that to none of you it comes as a surprise that I‚Äôll be saying something about Napoleon. The great French general that became Emperor and conquered Europe in an attempt to bring peace at all costs. Napoleon's times were the ones where armies represented their leaders, not governments. You bring your army to meet the enemy and have a joust with the lives of men that you inherit by birthright. If you look at a map again, though, you‚Äôll see that there is a big difference in size between Russia and every other major power. That does not provide European states with many options on what to do when at war. You don‚Äôt have a lot of time before the enemy is at your gates knocking for submission. You need to meet him in the field as fast as possible at a place that provides you with some advantage. In the case of Russia, you are looking at a state that has as much land as the entire European continent, meaning that you have precious time before the enemy could reach you. Such vast distances are not easy to cover even today. Military logistics are especially hard or harder to maintain the further you are from home. And just to consider the trek with thousands of troops on horseback, cavalry, and cannons, you are talking about a serious effort. It took the French army nearly a month to go from Smolensk to Moscow. That's 400 km or 250 miles. Today, this is a day‚Äôs journey for the family vacation. For today‚Äôs army, it would maybe take two or three days without meeting resistance. Back then, you had a horse to take care of and feed, not just the soldier. The vastness of the country meant that you had to deal with wide open spaces that offer no cover or shelter. Problems that you may encounter throw your projected timelines out the window again, meaning that the impossible perfection is your only option; one missed step and your house of cards is flattened. Everything must be counted on the spot before sending even a scout to the east because, my friends, the east has passive bonuses for which few are prepared. The first ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù comes with the Russian Empire just existing in the borders that we know it. Size matters here, and in a way unknown to people that haven‚Äôt gone there (like myself). When dealing with vast lands, speed is the biggest problem that you have in order not to fall victim to the second ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGeneral winter.‚Äù When those two are combined in one place that is inhabited by humans, they have the advantage of preparedness against you. You find yourself in a cold desert that‚Äôs eating you away faster than the hot one. So when Napoleon came around wanting to teach the Russians a lesson, they said, ‚ÄúOh yeah? Let‚Äôs fuc*ing go.‚Äù They bought some time by challenging the French army in battle while emptying Moscow of its inhabitants and leaving nothing behind for conquering and no one to be defeated. The city was burned because during those times the whole town was made of wood, and the French were left speechless, holding nothing in their hands thinking there are birds in the bush. Their prize now became a trap. The longer they stayed in, the fewer of them had chances of survival. The French were ambushed on their way into Russia and on their way out. 600,000+ men were entering and around 100,000 survived. In the case of China, the wall is meant to serve as a barrier that is forcing the enemy to come in from a position of disadvantage. In the case of Russia, the disadvantage for the enemy is the widening of the funnel. Open space serves as a challenge that breaks wills and backs on its own. Add to it guerrilla fighters, and you can consider that you might be in hell. Space so widely open that makes a dark tunnel a bringer of hope. It‚Äôs really hard for me to convey the message of losing 500,000 lives mostly to battlefield conditions, and again those conditions are having to cross a country during cold weather. That‚Äôs how big Russian passive bonuses are‚Äîthey have the land fighting on their side.

Barbarossa: Going Deeper

And now we come to Mr. Hitler. Poor old Adolf didn‚Äôt want to bow while entering Napoleon's tomb. The legend says that he had mirrors put in such a way that they reflected the interior of the room for the eyes of the F√ºhrer. In my opinion, he saw Napoleon as a failure for not dealing with the inferior (in his eyes) Slavic ‚Äúvermin‚Äù and was about to show the world how it‚Äôs done. Pesky Russians, though, saw what Hitler was doing and decided to cover their bets in a pact whose name lives to this day. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was one where the now Soviet Union took even more land, agreeing with Hitler's Germany to split Poland in half between the two and not fight each other. One can argue that Stalin saw the potential in petrol-powered transport of this new age and considered that they were giving the Russians much less time for their decision-making process. Then the Germans saw what the French saw earlier. The widening of the funnel made any army look like an ant colony going to war, making its way through an airfield. After some unsuccessful battles with the Germans that saw millions of Russian soldiers surrendering, the home team decided to again use the home advantage. Stretch out their forces so that they can‚Äôt support each other and wait for winter. Factories and production were moved in an enormous effort from the near-front cities to the Ural mountains, and cities where the enemy was met became fortresses. After the Russians found out about the mass murder of their surrendered countrymen, they realized that it was better to die fighting instead of hoping for mercy from an enemy that made decisions based on blood purity. Russians responded to German hell with their own version and allowed the land to cripple the German forces while the Russian bear gave a hug to the Wehrmacht so that it‚Äôs easier to bite its head off. Both civilian and military casualties are considered to be 30+ million‚Ä¶ Unimaginable numbers that would‚Äôve been higher if the passive bonuses weren‚Äôt relevant. Germany again had enormous problems supporting its troops, believing that airdrops with supplies would be sufficient‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt. Russians brought in soldiers from Siberia, a place known for its weather with temperatures regularly falling to -40/50 degrees Celsius, fresh soldiers that were used to the cold against Germans with frozen hands and noses just falling off from their faces. This is where the third ‚Äúpassive bonus‚Äù plays its part: locals that have adapted to the first two. Germany proved that even the modern industrialized world was not able to deal adequately with the Russian challenge card. In Moscow, notes were taken. When time came to deal with the rest of the world, Stalin made sure that when he sat at the table with Churchill and Roosevelt, he would redraw the maps of Europe in a way to give Russia even more space for its enemies to cover. The Soviet Union now enveloped the whole of Eastern Europe and half of Germany. Russia made a wall of land so big that made the whole world fear the bear. With the creation of atomic weapons, both bear and eagle created a doctrine that made war impossible for fear of destroying the world.

Modern Problems and Modern Solutions

With the collapse or disbanding of the Soviet Union, new countries emerged on the map with the claim that they were always there. One of these fresh faces was Ukraine. One of the gates leading to Russia became a revolving door. A revolving door is still something that allows the Russian state peace of mind. A revolving door works both ways, and that worked as an option on which the new post-Cold War world could create a baseline for warming relationships. But there was still a remnant of the decades-long rivalry called NATO, a cheeky loophole for international relations where member states can cry uncle when attacked and rely on the backing of other members when dealing with the consequences of the actions of individual state actors. And so a barrier was created for Russia where a point is made to isolate the country by making it impossible for it to have its military as a consideration when dealing with foreign countries. Meaning by not being able to project its power, Russia is having to accept any deal that it‚Äôs given. Now, when this NATO barrier is about to envelop Ukraine, Russia is in the position of not having any of its ‚Äúpassive bonuses‚Äù in the event of defending itself. If Ukraine is in NATO, it ultimately becomes a force against Russia that transforms the passive bonus of open space into a passive bonus against Russia in the form of an enormous staging area right on the border. That‚Äôs like your neighbor getting the big speakers out of his living room and placing them at your front door: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only play music if you annoy me,‚Äù he says. Soldiers start from the end of the trek prepared for the battlefield conditions, and Russia lays exposed, fighting against an enemy that has adopted the home advantage and then some.

And this is how simple it is in the end: if Russia is to have autonomy and security, it needs either the revolving door or the gate. By continuing the war, Europe is choosing for Ukraine to be a gate. Do mind that Russian national security allows for a revolving door‚Ä¶
