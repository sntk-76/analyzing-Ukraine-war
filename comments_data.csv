l8lklzv,"Putin and peace proposals are in the news again, so I think it is worth repeating:

* Any peace deal that leaves Ukraine without NATO membership or an equivalent strong binding military alliance against Russia (with the lack of NATO or such alliance often labeled misleadingly as ""Ukrainian neutrality"") is not a peace deal but only a temporary ceasefire, which Russia will break the moment they think they have a good opportunity. Without an alliance, there is nothing to enforce Russia following the treaty. Same goes for any peace deal that seeks to disarm Ukraine. And in fact Russian proposals have generally demanded both neutrality and disarmament.

* Russian proposals generally are not serious, as evidenced by them making demands such as above. Such unserious proposals have only the purpose of attempting to buy Russia time to reorganise for new offensives, or to feed grotesquely false propaganda along the lines of ""Russia wants peace, but Ukraine doesn't want it / NATO won't let Ukraine do it"".

* Russia has repeatedly broken treaties and agreements and as a consequence has very little credibility and is not to be trusted. Russian propaganda will constantly point towards supposed vague verbal promises about NATO expansion made to Gorbachev, which never entered any formal written treaty, while it has constantly broken everything from the Helsinki Accords, to the Russia-NATO Founding act, to the Budapest memorandum, to the Minks agreements, all of which are actual formal treaties.

* The sole responsibility for this war is on Russia, Russia is the one who invaded and started the war and continues it, and it is entirely within Russia's options to immediately make peace: Russia can end the war at any time simply by withdrawing from Ukrainian territory. 

The correct answer to any Russian ""peace proposals"" is and remains this: Or Russia could just go home.",1bkysju
lhs8gls,"Ukraine not telling anyone about its plans is good, because

1. In a case like this, it is better to ask forgiveness rather than permission. There are a lot of NATO people who seem to be afraid of their own shadow in their quest to avoid ""escalation"".
2. There are a surprising number of unreliable people or outright traitors in NATO militaries, who might've leaked the plans. Or someone could have leaked the plans accidentally or had spies intercept them, like with that meeting of German military officers.

Indeed, the secrecy has been very impressive. I follow a lot of different Ukraine war sources, and saw zero hints that Ukraine was planning something. Which makes sense, because if the Russian leadership didn't know, then random bloggers certainly wouldn't know.

*The writer, co-winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Peace, heads the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv and is on the board of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting*

My friend, a writer, texted last night from his trench to say a gentle goodbye. His unit is expecting an attack any time, but they do not have the heavy artillery they need to repel the assault.

I am thousands of miles away from Ukraine, on a six-city lecture tour across the US, addressing public meetings and briefing members of Congress. But the war stays with us Ukrainians wherever we may travel. Rest is impossible when, back home, the delay in delivering crucial arms is costing the lives of our friends, our relatives, our countrymen.

The $60bn US package has been stalled for months by what, for Americans, is domestic politics; for us Ukrainians, it is a matter of life and death. In my meetings here, I am frequently asked: since Ukraine cannot expect to defeat Russia on the battlefield, shouldn‚Äôt it accept a land deal? Won‚Äôt more arms just mean more death?

Indeed, Ukraine has seen far too much death ‚Äî I know, because my colleagues and I see it daily. For the past decade, my organisation has documented war crimes by Russian forces occupying my country. Since the full invasion in February 2022, the scale of crimes has escalated exponentially. With a network of Ukrainian groups, we have documented killings, rape and torture ‚Äî beatings, peeling off fingernails, genital electric shock. One woman I interviewed had her eye extracted by a spoon. To date, we have documented 68,000 crimes.

Yet this is only the tip of the iceberg, because such crimes are central to both the method and the purpose of the invasion. The Russian position, as the president has made repeatedly clear, is that Ukrainian language and culture, that Ukraine and Ukrainians, do not exist.

A premature deal would be wrong ‚Äî not least because we tried it already, and it failed. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas. Ukraine was not able to respond effectively, and the international response was muted. A ceasefire was then agreed. All Russia did was use the next eight years to prepare forward bases for the next attack. Moscow will only do the same again.

An early deal would also be immoral. You do not make peace by disarming the invaded country. This would be occupation and we know what that would mean.

In a de-occupied area of the Kharkiv region, after the Ukraine army pushed Russian forces back, the degraded body of beloved Ukrainian children‚Äôs writer Volodymyr Vakulenko was discovered in an unmarked mass grave in the Izyum woods. After extensive investigation, the Russian soldiers responsible for this crime have recently been identified.

Why kill a children‚Äôs writer? Russia kills Ukrainian civilians because it can. After decades of brutal warfare ‚Äî in Chechnya, in Syria and beyond ‚Äî it has never been held accountable.

Russia is now increasing its assaults on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, and we expect a major attack this summer. Our capital city, my home, could again be under direct threat.

In the meantime, destabilisation activities are under way against Moldova and other neighbouring countries. Moscow is the centre but Russia‚Äôs imperial vision has no defined borders. This nightmare ‚Äî this endless cataloguing of human pain ‚Äî will only continue.

The solution is to defeat Russia and this authoritarian ideology. A stand must be made, and Ukrainians are bravely making it. War is horrible. But Ukrainians know what Russia brings, and the clear majority of the population ‚Äî more than 70 per cent ‚Äî support continuing the fight ‚Äúas long as it takes‚Äù.

We respect American politics. We know every country has its own priorities and financial issues. We are grateful for the generous support we have received so far from the US, Europe and other countries around the world, both from governments and ordinary citizens. But now we need more help, and we need it soon. Ukraine wants peace more than anyone. But we cannot fight evil with empty hands. Strengthen Ukraine, let us pursue the war as far as we can ‚Äî our vision is to the internationally recognised 1991 borders ‚Äî and then we can discuss peace. Our friends in Russian human rights groups tell us the same: the best way to help Russian democracy is to defeat Russian militarism in Ukraine.

This is not a war for land. It is a war for survival. Not just of the Ukrainian people but of the basic values of human rights, of democracy, of liberty. The majority of American people know this and support more aid for Ukraine. The majority of members of Congress agree. Meanwhile, I continue to get text messages from the front every night. Will the US send fresh arms before it is too late?",1bkysju

The last time David Cameron, Britain‚Äôs foreign secretary, urged Capitol Hill to pass Ukraine aid, he was told to ‚Äúkiss my ass‚Äù by Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most vocal pro-Russia Republicans. Washington largely treated the Georgia legislator as a joke when she was first elected. Now Greene is threatening the speakership of her party leader, Mike Johnson, if he tries to pass Ukraine funding. Her threat is not empty. Johnson is as keen on remaining speaker as he is lukewarm on Ukraine. His path of least resistance would be to fold. 

That is also the advice that Republican leaders are offering Ukraine in spite of increasingly urgent opposing pleas from allies. Tellingly, Johnson refused to meet Cameron on his latest trip to Washington this week. Donald Trump says that Ukraine should cede the Donbas and Crimea to Russia in exchange for a ceasefire ‚Äî an outcome he would impose on day one of his presidency. Some Republicans still want to supply Ukraine with weapons. But they are in a minority. The Republican right treats Ukraine as an enemy and Russia as a friend. Defining that stance as isolationist is lazy and wrong. It is actively pro-Russian. 

‚ÄúThe Ukrainian government is attacking Christians,‚Äù says Greene. ‚ÄúThe Ukrainian government is executing priests. Russia is not doing that. They are not attacking Christianity. As a matter of fact they seem to be protecting it.‚Äù Michael Whatley, Trump‚Äôs handpicked co-chair of the Republican National Committee, openly calls Ukraine an enemy. ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äôs feckless leadership has shown China, has shown Ukraine, has shown Iran, that they can feel free to be much more aggressive on the world front to the point where even they will try and meddle with our elections here,‚Äù he told Fox. 

The Republican right‚Äôs pro-Russia interventionism is two-way. As Catherine Belton, author of Putin‚Äôs People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and Then Took on the West, reported this week, Russian troll factories are giving Greene‚Äôs Republicans their talking points. Ken Buck, one of many Republican legislators to have recently quit politics in despair, calls Greene ‚ÄúMoscow Marjorie‚Äù. Her fictional claim that Ukraine is executing priests and fighting to spread a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù agenda comes straight from the Kremlin. Historians compare Trump to Charles Lindbergh‚Äôs pro-Nazi ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù movement in the early 1940s. The difference is that Lindbergh got nowhere near the White House.

Washington has warned Turkey that there will be ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù if the country does not curtail its exports to Russia of US military-linked hardware that is vital to Moscow‚Äôs war machine. 

Matthew Axelrod, assistant commerce secretary leading US efforts to keep sensitive technology out of the hands of America‚Äôs adversaries, recently met Turkish officials and executives in Ankara and Istanbul as part of efforts to halt the illicit trade. His message, according to a senior commerce department official, was that Turkey must work harder to curb trade in American-origin chips and other parts that are pivotal for Moscow‚Äôs war in Ukraine. 

‚ÄúWe need Turkey to help us stop the illicit flow of US technology to Russia,‚Äù Axelrod said in a statement to the Financial Times. ‚ÄúWe need to see progress, and quickly, by Turkish authorities and industry or we will have no choice but to impose consequences on those that evade our export controls,‚Äù he added.

Washington‚Äôs warning is the latest sign of how Turkey‚Äôs decision to retain strong trade ties with Russia has tarnished relations between the two Nato allies. The US, EU and other western partners have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but Turkey has eschewed the curbs and increased trade with the country since the war broke out.

The US is particularly worried that Turkey has become a key hub through which western-made electronics, including processors, memory cards and amplifiers, are making their way to Russian missiles and drones in contravention of export controls. Machine tools are another significant area of concern.",1bkysju

>(...)  
Brekelmans (MinDef) confirms this (ChoD's comments) and points out that the Netherlands had previously made this clear: ""The law of war says that if attacks against Ukraine originate inside of Russia, it is allowed to strike military targets. For the F-16's this would mean that if - for example -  a missile is launched inside of Russia, you would be allowed to use an F-16 to intercept it inside of Russia.""

>

>The Minister also says that airfields from which Russian jets take off and which are used to launch bombs are also legitimate targets under the law of war. Brekelmans says that the attacks should not be targeted against civilian targets: ""Ukraine is clearly not allowed to do that. Those are the requirements we set.""

>Brekelmans acknowledges that are discussions with other allies about 'The space you'd want Ukraine to have."" He says that Russia is launching strikes from ever greater ranges and that those attacks using aerial guided bombs (NOTE: In Dutch, the NOS article mentions 'luchtgeleide bommen', the straight translation of which would be 'aerially-guided bombs', which is a bit clunky. I think the author might be referring to things like glide bombs, or PGMs in general) are getting more intensive. ""So you need to keep discussing what Ukraine needs to defend itself.""

Given the choice between a military that can defeat Russia after a while with some difficulty, and a military that can defeat Russia quickly and easily, you want the latter.

Overkill can make a huge difference. It can make a difference of tens of thousands civilian lives and trillions of euros in damages. Especially for example for the Baltic states, which would likely be occupied for a dangerously long time in the case of a ""surprise"" invasion by Russia. Having USA be a reliable ally is very useful, of course Europeans are not going to be happy if USA cannot be trusted any more due to things like Trump basically stating that he would destroy NATO. 

That is what I think is missed in all these discussions about USA and European defense that always seem to just collapse into a ""Hurr durr Europe cannot defend itself, freeloaders"" circlejerk.

l8ecxdy," The United States on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.
Among the steps, the U.S. Treasury said it was raising ""the risk of secondary sanctions for foreign financial institutions that deal with Russia's war economy,"" effectively threatening them with losing access to the U.S. financial system.

It also said it was moving to restrict the Russian military industrial base's ability to exploit certain U.S. software and information technology services and, with the State Department, targeting more than 300 individuals and entities in Russia and beyond, including in Asia, Europe and Africa.
Separately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly $100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips.

It will also expand its lists of items Russia cannot import from other nations to cover not just U.S.-origin products but U.S.-branded goods, meaning those made with U.S. intellectual property or technology, a senior Commerce official told reporters on condition of anonymity. 

Peter Harrell, who served as White House senior director for international economics in 2021 and 2022, described the latest sanctions as a ""paradigm shift,"" partly because they expose foreign banks to the risk of being cut off from the U.S. financial system if they deal with key large Russian banks.
The Treasury accomplished this by increasing to 4,500 the universe of Russian companies and individuals who could trigger such sanctions from about 1,200, the senior Treasury official told reporters.
""For the first time, the U.S. is shifting towards something that begins to look like ... an effort to set up a global financial embargo on Russia,"" Harrell said.

""The message here is really one to banks in China and Turkey and the UAE and elsewhere outside of the G7 they face sanctions for continuing to engage in transactions with the big Russian banks and other sanctioned Russian banks,"" he added, saying this would likely spark a ""major retreat"" by those banks from Russia.
""That financial pullback, in turn, is probably going ... to complicate the flow of goods from countries that are continuing to trade with Russia,"" he said.

Poland and other countries bordering Ukraine have a ‚Äúduty‚Äù to shoot down incoming Russian missiles before they enter their airspace despite the opposition of Nato, the Polish foreign minister has said.

Rados≈Çaw Sikorski told the Financial Times in an interview that Warsaw had an obligation to ensure the safety of its citizens irrespective of fears that interceptions over Ukrainian territory could embroil the Atlantic alliance in Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine.

‚ÄúMembership in Nato does not trump each country‚Äôs responsibility for the protection of its own airspace ‚Äî it‚Äôs our own constitutional duty,‚Äù Sikorski said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm personally of the view that, when hostile missiles are on course of entering our airspace, it would be legitimate self-defence [to strike them] because once they do cross into our airspace, the risk of debris injuring someone is significant.‚Äù

Poland signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine earlier this summer in which the two countries undertook to examine ‚Äúthe feasibility of possible intercepting in Ukraine‚Äôs airspace missiles and UAVs fired in the direction of territory of Poland, following necessary procedures agreed by the states and organisations involved‚Äù.

However, Jens Stoltenberg, the outgoing Nato secretary-general, rejected the proposal, saying it risked the alliance ‚Äúbecoming part of the conflict‚Äù.

Sikorski insisted on his country‚Äôs right to intercept after a suspected Russian drone crossed into Poland on August 26.

- As inflation is easing, the ministry won't have to spend as much for its own needs as it otherwise would have. The decision has been made to use the substantial savings from this to increase aid to Ukraine.
- The 78 [CAESARs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAESAR_self-propelled_howitzer) being produced for Ukraine this year are fully funded; by Ukraine, Denmark and France.
- The French stocks of [Aster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_(missile_family\)) air defence missiles are ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù, but 22 of them have been fired by the French navy to shoot down Houthi drones or missiles, and Ukraine fires them from its SAMP/T to intercept Russian missiles, so 200 new missiles have been ordered, and another 200 will be soon.

He said France was looking at providing hundreds of VAB (V√©hicule de l'Avant Blind√©) front-line troop carriers in 2024 and early 2025.
France's army is gradually replacing its thousands of VABs, which first went into operation in the late 1970s, with a new multi-role troop carrier. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9hicule_de_l%27Avant_Blind%C3%A9

Lecornu added that France was also preparing to release a new batch of Aster 30 surface-to-air missiles for the SAMP/T system provided to Kyiv. The Aster 30 can intercept warplanes, drones and cruise missiles within a range of 120 km.
""Ukraine has an urgent need for better ground-air defence ... Russia is intensifying its strikes, in particular on civilians and civil infrastructure,"" he said.
Lecornu said he had asked government defence procurement agency DGA (Direction Generale de l'Armement) to make proposals to accelerate production of Aster missiles, manufactured by European group MBDA.
Aster missiles are also being used in the Red Sea, where French frigates defend maritime traffic against attacks from Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, he said. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-send-old-armoured-vehicles-new-missiles-ukraine-2024-03-31/",1bkysju

l0f3imp,"Through comparative historical analysis, we find that Russia‚Äôs strategic communications regarding nuclear weapons use in Ukraine broadly reflect Soviet strategy during the Cold War. The Soviet Union employed a combination of aggressive and defensive propaganda narratives regarding nuclear weapons; the former aimed to coerce the West away from interfering in Soviet military interventions abroad, while the latter sought to convince international audiences that the West was primarily to blame for escalations in tensions. Russia continues to employ this same strategy to provide protective cover for its ongoing war on Ukraine. In both cases, actual Soviet and Russian nuclear posture remained significantly less bellicose than its propaganda narratives imply. 

Our analysis suggests that Russia‚Äôs aggressive rhetoric about nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine has thus far been primarily intended to shape Western decision-making, rather than a genuine expression of intent to use such weapons. In Ukraine, nuclear ‚Äòred lines‚Äô advanced by Russian propaganda have consistently been eroded without response, including significant strikes on Crimea, advanced weapons supplied to Ukraine, and the re-taking of illegally annexed territory. Nevertheless, Russia‚Äôs nuclear propaganda has been one of its most successful cognitive warfare efforts in limiting or delaying critical Western military support to Ukraine, on the grounds of avoiding potential escalation. While Russia‚Äôs nuclear arsenal remains a significant threat to Ukraine and the West, an overly cautious response to Russian rhetoric also risks potentially significant geopolitical consequences by tacitly rewarding nuclear threats. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13518046.2023.2297586",1bkysju

Mysterious buyers with suspected links to Russia have begun amassing dozens of vessels capable of carrying liquefied natural gas, in moves that suggest Moscow is expanding its ‚Äúdark fleet‚Äù of energy tankers.

Shipping industry insiders say a clutch of previously unknown companies, largely registered in the United Arab Emirates, have rapidly acquired LNG vessels over the past year, driving up market prices, especially for the oldest ships.

The buying spree has echoes of how Moscow established a dark fleet of tankers to shuttle oil around the globe in the face of western sanctions, often using the UAE as a centre for energy trades. Although Russian LNG sales are less affected by western sanctions than oil, Moscow has been preparing for restrictions to tighten.

Since the second quarter of 2023, more than 50 LNG vessels have changed ownership to companies located in the UAE, according to Windward, a risk consultancy for shipowners and governments. Prior to that, such transactions were rare.

Ship tracking group Kpler‚Äôs risk and compliance team said the developments in the LNG tanker market pointed ‚Äúto a complex network of maritime operations potentially linked to Russian interests‚Äù.

Some of the Dubai-based groups have opaque ownership structures that are similar to those operating Moscow‚Äôs dark fleet of oil tankers.

Some of the newly acquired LNG vessels are now navigating routes traditionally used for transporting gas from Russia, according to Kpler. Its ship-tracking data showed one vessel loading LNG from Yamal, Russia‚Äôs flagship export project that has yet to be hit by sanctions.

LNG has grown in importance for Russia‚Äôs wartime economy, providing valuable income after the loss of pipeline exports to Europe since its full- scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both the EU and Asia, big markets for Russian LNG, have refrained from imposing a ban on imports to avoid disruption to the global gas market.

But the west has begun to take steps to restrict trade. In June, the EU approved restrictions that will forbid the unloading of Russian LNG from large icebreaking ships on to smaller vessels at EU ports, significantly limiting Russia‚Äôs options for distributing its gas globally.

Russia‚Äôs big LNG project, Arctic LNG 2, has also been placed under sanctions by the US, making it increasingly difficult to ship cargoes out of the project.

Traders say more opaque fleets could facilitate trading out of projects under sanctions, as well as boosting Russia‚Äôs operations in the market.",1bkysju

Experts have suggested a plan to replace Russian gas flowing to Europe through Ukraine with gas from Azerbaijan risks becoming a conduit for the disguised export of fuel from Russia.

Gas from Russia is pumped to Europe through pipelines that transit Ukraine. Kyiv is considering trying to replace that supply with Azeri gas.

But that replacement fuel would probably have to travel through Russia and Ukraine to reach Europe ‚Äî and Baku would only be able to provide a small proportion of the quantity now reaching the continent from Russia, raising questions about how the scheme would operate in practice.

Mykhailo Gonchar, president of the Centre for Global Studies Strategy XXI and a leading expert on Ukrainian gas, said the deal risked ‚Äúturn[ing] into a scheme involving the hidden export of Russian gas in the form of Azerbaijani gas to the European market‚Äù.",1bkysju

Russia‚Äôs war of conquest in Ukraine has now been going on for two and a half years. It has turned into a war of attrition. One contributing factor is that military support from the west has been insufficient, delayed and burdened with too many restrictions. The ongoing incursion into Russian territory suggests, however, that, if provided with enough resources, Ukraine can assert itself on the battlefield.

The Russian leadership believes that time is on its side, expecting the west will eventually tire of supporting Ukraine, allowing Russia to withstand the costs of the war much longer. This is paradoxical, given that the west‚Äôs economic resources far exceed those of Russia.

As Europe‚Äôs struggles to scale up weapons and ammunition production have demonstrated, it may be challenging to translate economic strength into military capability in the short term. However, in a prolonged conflict, differences in economic resources are likely to be decisive.

As the price level is systematically lower in poorer countries than in richer, purchasing power-adjusted GDP measures should be used when comparing GDP in different countries. According to the World Bank, Ukraine‚Äôs PPP-adjusted GDP is barely a 10th of Russia‚Äôs. This represents a huge economic disadvantage for Ukraine. The reason is not only that Russia‚Äôs population is nearly four times as big but also that GDP per capita is about twice as high. At the same time, GDP is approximately nine times larger in the US, the EU and the UK combined than in Russia. The joint GDP of the EU and the UK is five times larger than Russia‚Äôs. Hence, the west can mobilise substantial resources to support Ukraine without its standard of living being more than marginally affected.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia‚Äôs military spending in 2023 was 5.9 per cent of GDP, while Ukraine‚Äôs was as high as 37 per cent. This means that Russia spent approximately $150bn more. Assume that the west needs to contribute that amount to enable Ukraine to hold its ground. That corresponds to only 0.26 per cent of GDP in the US, EU and UK combined. If the EU and UK alone were to fund the support, it would constitute 0.48 per cent of their GDP.

Further assume that 30 per cent more resources are needed on the Ukrainian side to compensate for the smaller population base and to prevail, in the sense of retaking a significant portion of the occupied territories. Support of around $265bn would then be required. This corresponds to 0.45 per cent of the GDP of the US, EU and UK, and 0.85 per cent of the GDP of the EU and the UK.

These calculations are rough. If Russia increases military spending or Ukraine is forced to reduce its own, the need for support is underestimated. It is overestimated to the extent that not all Russian military expenditures pertain to the war in Ukraine, and additional support for Ukraine is likely to arrive from countries such as Canada and Norway. 

However, the computations illustrate orders of magnitude. Compared with Russia‚Äôs war costs, the economic sacrifices of western countries in terms of GDP to provide Ukraine with the necessary support are small. The latter costs amount to far less than one year‚Äôs normal GDP growth. This holds true for Europe as well if it were to bear the entire burden of support should the US contribution cease.

Supporting Ukraine should be viewed as an investment to avoid much greater future costs ‚Äî not just financial but potentially also human. A Russian victory in Ukraine could lead to further aggression. The opportunity cost of not providing sufficient support now could be huge, setting a dangerous precedent that states can annex the territory of others through conquest ‚Äî something we believed the world had left behind after the second world war. This could have devastating consequences for the future, not only in Europe but around the world.

The west has the economic resources to help Ukraine withstand Russia‚Äôs aggression and the burden of this support will be manageable. The safest way to create peace in Ukraine is for the west to commit to giving the country the assistance it needs, so that the costs of continuing the war become clear to Russia. This could eventually force Moscow to reverse course. It is true that at present there are no signs of such a development. But history tells us that, unlike in democracies, when change comes in dictatorships and autocracies, it does so suddenly and without much prior warning.",1bkysju

kxil5mq,"Ukrainian forces appear to have repelled a Russian battalion-sized mechanized assault near Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, on March 30 ‚Äî the first battalion-sized mechanized assault since Russian forces began the campaign to seize Avdiivka in late October 2023. A Ukrainian serviceman reported on March 31 that Russian forces, including elements of the Russian 6th Tank Regiment (90th Tank Division, Central Military District [CMD]), committed 36 tanks and 12 BMP infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) to a large-mechanized assault near Tonenke on March 30.[20] Geolocated imagery published on March 31 shows a large number of destroyed and damaged Russian armored vehicles and tanks along a road northwest of Tonenke (west of Avdiivka).[21] 

The Ukrainian serviceman stated that Ukrainian forces destroyed 12 Russian tanks and eight IFVs during the assault and noted that the frontal assault failed to breakthrough the Ukrainian line. This appears to be the first report of any elements of the 90th Tank Division participating in assaults following the Russian seizure of Avdiivka and ISW previously assessed that elements of the 90th Tank Division, alongside other Russian units and formations, likely represent a sizeable uncommitted operational reserve that the Russian military command can commit to continue and intensify efforts to push west of Avdiivka.[22] The elements of the 6th Tank Regiment appear to have failed in their March 30 attack near Tonenke, however, suggesting that elements of Russia‚Äôs uncommitted operational reserve near Avdiivka may be too degraded or otherwise unable to lead further Russian advances westward in the short term.

The scale of the Russian mechanized assault on March 30 is significant. Russian forces have not conducted a mechanized assault this large since the beginning of the Russian localized offensive effort to seize Avdiivka in late October 2023, when Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed almost 50 Russian tanks and over 100 armored vehicles on October 19-20, 2023.[23] Ukraine‚Äôs ability to defend against the March 30 assault, particularly near Avdiivka where Ukrainian forces have been forced to quickly withdraw to new, defensive positions following the loss of the settlement, is a positive indicator for Ukraine‚Äôs ability to defend against future large-scale Russian assaults and the expected summer 2024 Russian offensive operation. 

Ukrainian officials, justifiably so, continue to warn about Ukraine‚Äôs ability to defend against the expected summer Russian offensive effort in the face of ammunition shortages, manpower limitations, and delayed Western assistance.[24] Ukrainian forces may have had to expend a significant amount of material to defend against the Russian assault near Tonenke, highlighting Russia‚Äôs ability to conduct assaults that force Ukraine to expend outsized portions of its already limited material and manpower reserves to defend against.[25] Ukraine‚Äôs demonstrated ability to skillfully defend against a large-scale Russian assault in a particularly critical part of the front despite Ukraine‚Äôs challenges suggests that Ukrainian forces can achieve significant battlefield effects if they are properly equipped.

The Russian command may be prioritizing the Avdiivka area in Donetsk Oblast. The Russian military command‚Äôs willingness to commit a battalion‚Äôs worth of tanks to an attack near Avdiivka indicates that this assault was a priority effort. The Russian command may focus their forecasted late spring/summer 2024 offensive operation on western Donetsk Oblast in hopes of building upon Russian forces‚Äô steady but marginal advances in this sector.[26] Ukrainian officials have recently warned that Russian forces are accumulating personnel along the Kharkiv-Luhansk axis, near Bakhmut, near Avdiivka, and in western Zaporizhia Oblast, but ISW continues to assess that Russian forces will likely only be able to launch a concerted large-scale offensive operation in one operational direction at a time due to Russia‚Äôs own manpower and planning limitations.[27]

lj03tkc,"The Kremlin's response to Ukraine's incursion into Kursk Oblast has emphasized how the Kremlin's internal priorities have increasingly oriented towards regime stability, especially over the past year. Russian opposition outlet Vazhnye Istorii reported on August 19 that Russian President Vladimir Putin's reaction to the ""Kursk situation"" has exposed certain shifts within the Kremlin's power vertical, many of which have been underway over the last several months.[17] 

Putin appointed Presidential Aide Alexei Dyumin to supervise the ongoing ""counterterrorism"" operation against Ukrainian activities in Kursk Oblast, which Vazhnye Istorii noted means that Putin distrusts the Russian General Staff and the Russian Ministry of Defense (which would be the bodies theoretically in charge of defensive military activities) and relies on individuals that he personally trusts. 

An insider source reportedly told Vazhnye Istorii that Dyumin is now in conflict with representatives of the Russian Presidential Administration, further suggesting that Putin continues to align himself with those who have his personal favor at the expense of officials better technically suited for certain positions. Vazhnye Istorii also cited sources familiar with the Russian security services as claiming that Federal Security Service (FSB) Head Alexander Bortnikov will ""leave his post this year"" and theorizing that his potential replacement may be Vladislav Menshchikov, head of the FSB's counterintelligence service, or Sergei Korolev, Bortnikov's first deputy. 

Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov noted that the FSB has generally shifted its mandate away from controlling Russian oligarchs and towards controlling Russia‚Äôs military and Russia‚Äôs military-industrial complex as well as countering ""saboteurs and terrorists,"" and Vazhnye Istorii reported that several long-time Russian economic oligarchs are also gradually losing their influence within the Kremlin's wider power vertical.[18]

Vazhnye Istorii's reporting strongly suggests that the Kremlin has increasingly oriented its main priorities towards regime stability. ISW has reported at length on Putin's efforts to maintain a core cadre of loyal siloviki (Russian strongmen with political influence) within the Russian power vertical, particularly since the risks to Putin's regime first introduced by the Wagner Group's armed rebellion in June 2023.[19] The Kremlin's general shift towards siloviki such as Dyumin, whom Putin personally trusts, and security officials with strong and well-documented reputations in counterterrorism and counterintelligence, suggests that the Kremlin is increasingly looking towards such individuals as regime safeguards. 

Ukraine's operation into Kursk Oblast has particularly exposed this dynamic, and the Kremlin's continued response to the incursion further emphasizes the ever-increasing reliance on security officials and structures over more politically or economically focused internal structures. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-19-2024",1bkysju

l2292ia,"The longer this war lasts, the better Russia will get at learning, adapting, and building a more effective, modern fighting force. Slowly but surely, Moscow will absorb new ideas from the battlefield and rearrange its tactics accordingly. Its strategic adaptation already helped it fend off Ukraine‚Äôs counteroffensive, and over the last few months it has helped Russian troops take more territory from Kyiv. Ultimately, if Russia‚Äôs edge in strategic adaptation persists without an appropriate Western response, the worst that can happen in this war is not stalemate. It is a Ukrainian defeat.

This should concern western strategists for several reasons.

First, and most immediately, a more effective Russian military can be more successful in the offensive operations they are conducting now and over the next few months. This tactical success, as explored earlier, also has strategic impacts for Russia.

Second, a more effective Russian military is better able to link tactical operations within campaigns and link them to Russian strategy. This was something they were poor at in the first few months of the war for a variety of reasons, including bad assumptions and pure arrogance. But a more effective Russian military has been able to industrialise the war and ensure that it can sustain both the personnel and materiel needs to sustain the war over the medium term. Without an effective western counter, ongoing assistance to Ukraine will be difficult.

Third, a more effective Russian military, which appears to have undertaken reforms in the past 26 months that it should have been undertaking under Gerasimov since 2012, will be an ongoing danger to its neighbours.  And not just European neighbours. We should remember that Russia has a presence in the Pacific (although many of its ground forces have been redeployed to Ukraine).

Finally, a more effective Russian military provides lessons to other predatory authoritarians. In some cases, Russia is probably sharing lessons directly with China, North Korea and Iran in return for dual use technologies and weapons. So, the more military effective Russia gets, the more this has the potential to lift the effectiveness of other potential threats to the west in the medium term.

Besides the moral and strategic imperatives to defend Ukraine and liberate all of its territory taken by Russia since 2014, we must also ensure the defeat of Russia as quickly as possible to deny them more opportunities to learn about modern war and help their strategic partners to do so.

The volume of losses have increased by one third since the last tally in August last year, underscoring the scale of the financial hit to the corporate world from Moscow's invasion, as well as highlighting the sudden loss of Western expertise from Russia's economy.

""As Russia's invasion continues amid faltering Western military aid, and the granularity of Western sanctions regimes increases, companies still aiming to exit Russia will likely face further difficulties and have to accept greater writedowns and losses,"" said Ian Massey, Head of Corporate Intelligence, EMEA, at global risk consultancy S-RM. 

Lawyer Jeremy Zucker, a sanctions expert, said a surprisingly large number of his firm's clients across a wide range of industries had decided to exit Russia entirely and would likely be reluctant to return even after hostilities end.
As a result, meaningful technologies have left the country and Russia may no longer be able to support certain high-tech production, said Zucker, chair of U.S. law firm Dechert's national security practice.
""It certainly suggests to me a meaningful degree of injury to the economy,"" he told Reuters.

kz53pup,"On the effects of this war on Russian-speakers in Estonia.

A scandal broke out after Estonia's football team captain, a Russian-speaker often regarded as a role model of integration, refused to support Ukraine and said peace can occur by either side winning or by compromise. This question was asked on the background of him having been involved in a previous scandal where many (mostly Russian-speaking) footballers posed with head coach of Russia's football team which was considered unethical during Russia's war of aggression.

This highlights a wide dissonance in the society where most Russian-speakers consider politics to be an isolated topic and do not share concerns for Russia's actions' unacceptability or Russia's ideology being existentially threatening for Baltics. Many of them see the scandals as unfair attacks for a stance for peace. This also means that cohesion with Russian-speakers remains very weak, and with the government soon to be ending Russian-speaking education, it may mean Russian-speakers are on track to face only two options in this country ‚Äì assimilation or marginalization.

On a related note, Estonia's minister of internal affairs says Russian Orthodox Church may be declared a terrorist organization. The Estonian Orthodox Church under Moscow Patriarchate has been under fire for refusing to cut links with Russian Orthodox Church, so this would force them to do so. For background information, Estonian Orthodox Church under Moscow Patriarchate is the biggest religious organization in Estonia, with members outnumbering the formerly dominant Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (as Estonians are mostly irreligious).

Hungary‚Äôs recent decision to ease visa restrictions for Russian visitors is an open door to spies and EU leaders should take urgent countermeasures, the bloc‚Äôs biggest political party has said.

Manfred Weber, chair of the European People‚Äôs party, in a letter seen by the Financial Times said the move would allow unvetted Russians to travel through much of the EU unhindered and raised ‚Äúserious national security concerns‚Äù.

Weber has written to European Council president Charles Michel to raise the issue at the next leaders‚Äô summit in October.

Hungary this month published details of a new fast-track visa system for citizens of eight countries, including Russia and Belarus, to enter Hungary without security checks or other restrictions. Budapest said many would be building a nuclear power plant with Russian technology.  

But Weber said the need for a new immigration system in Hungary was ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù and warned it could ‚Äúcreate grave loopholes for espionage activities, and potentially allowing large numbers of Russians to enter Hungary with minimal supervision, posing a serious risk to national security‚Äù. 

‚ÄúThis policy could also make it easier for Russians to move around the Schengen [borderless] area, bypassing the restrictions required by EU law.‚Äù

lipail7,"Key Takeaways:

* The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast and Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine are not in themselves decisive military operations that will win the war. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces lack the capability to conduct individual decisive war-winning operations and must instead conduct multiple successive operations with limited operational objectives that are far short of victory, but that in aggregate can achieve strategic objectives.
* It is too early to assess the outcomes and operational significance of the Ukrainian incursion into Russia and the ongoing Russian offensive effort in eastern Ukraine. The significance of these operations will not emerge in isolation, moreover, but they will matter in so far as they relate to a series of subsequent Russian and Ukrainian campaigns over time.
* Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military command likely view maintaining the theater-wide initiative as a strategic imperative to win a war of attrition against Ukraine, and both the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast and the Russian offensive effort in eastern Ukraine will impact whether Russian forces can retain the initiative in the short-term.
* Ukrainian officials have indicated that Ukraine's operation in Kursk Oblast does not have long-term territorial objectives but instead aims to generate theater-wide operational and strategic pressures on Russian forces.
* The Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast has already generated theater-wide operational and strategic pressures on Russian forces, and subsequent phases of fighting within Russia will likely generate even greater pressures on Putin and the Russian military.
* Russian forces will not be able to retain the initiative throughout eastern Ukraine indefinitely, and the culmination of Russian offensive operations will present Ukrainian forces with opportunities to contest the initiative further.
* The Russian offensive operation to seize Pokrovsk is emblematic of the Russian approach to the war in Ukraine that embraces positional warfare for gradual creeping advances and seeks to win a war of attrition.
* Ukraine's incursion into Kursk Oblast illustrates how Ukrainian forces can use maneuver warfare to offset Russian manpower and materiel advantages.
* It is simply too early to draw dispositive conclusions about the lasting effects that the two very different Russian and Ukrainian efforts will have on the course of the war.

Erdoƒüan likes to call the facility, being built by Russia‚Äôs state-owned Rosatom on the Mediterranean coast, ‚ÄúTurkey‚Äôs first nuclear power plant‚Äù. In reality, it belongs to Russia. In the standard engineering, procurement and construction model, the supplier designs and builds the reactor before turning over the keys. Akkuyu uses a build-own-operate (BOO) model unprecedented for the industry. Russia retains majority ownership but bears all the financial, operational and construction risks.

Moscow‚Äôs all-inclusive package covers construction, operation and personnel training, handling spent nuclear fuel and the ultimate decommissioning ‚Äî all very appealing for a nuclear newcomer like Turkey.

Ukrainian forces marginally advanced throughout their salient in Kursk Oblast amid continued Russian efforts to stop these advances on August 22.
* Recent Russian advances in the Pokrovsk direction appear to have prompted Ukrainian withdrawals from limited positions southeast of Pokrovsk, and Russian forces have likely failed to achieve their apparent objective of tactically encircling Ukrainian forces in the area.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has come under a barrage of criticism from soldiers, lawmakers and military analysts over the rapid advances made by the Russian army in eastern Ukraine since Kyiv launched its bold incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region.

Many Ukrainians celebrated their army‚Äôs invasion of Kursk on August 6, hoping the gamble would force Moscow to divert resources to the new front and swing the momentum of the war in Ukraine‚Äôs favour.

However, a breach in the frontline in the strategically important Donetsk region this week has triggered a backlash against the leadership in Kyiv, with critics arguing Ukraine‚Äôs positions were weakened by the redeployment of thousands of battle-hardened Ukrainian troops to the Kursk operation.

Russian forces are closing in on the strategically important city of Pokrovsk taking several nearby towns this week and forcing undermanned Ukrainian units to retreat from prepared defensive positions.

Pokrovsk is one of two key rail and road junctions in the Donetsk region and its loss would threaten the entire region‚Äôs logistics for Ukraine‚Äôs military, according to Frontelligence Insight, a Ukrainian analytical group.

(...)


Stanislav Aseyev, a Ukrainian journalist and soldier currently on the eastern front, warned of the possible ‚Äúdestruction of the entire southern group of forces in the region, not just Pokrovsk‚Äù.

He cited ‚Äúa complex of internal reasons: from the planting of flowers instead of fortifications to the lack of understanding on the part of high command of the problems evident to every soldier in the trenches‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat can be done for Pokrovsk?‚Äù he asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the only option is to evacuate as many people as possible. I think the town will soon cease to exist.‚Äù

Frontelligence said the Ukrainian leadership could yet shore up the frontline by deploying new brigades or repositioning forces from other areas. But if Pokrovsk were to fall, it could pave the way for Russian forces to push towards Dnipro, Ukraine‚Äôs fourth-largest city, extending their control further.",1bkysju

For now, Ukraine‚Äôs best way of keeping up the fight against Russia is to carry on with the sort of attacks it has been mounting regularly of late. These have used long-range drones against oil refineries and other targets with some strategic value in Russia. Ukraine won‚Äôt be able to use the long-range ATACMS missiles, or the extra Storm Shadow cruise missiles promised by Sunak in Warsaw this week, to attack targets in Russia proper. However, there are many military-related targets available in occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. 

While there are no easy ways to bring Russia to its knees, Russian vulnerabilities can be exposed. It will become harder for Vladimir Putin to see how he can bring the war to an early conclusion, which was certainly his hope before the vote in Congress. He might have hoped that the loss of a big city such as Kharkiv would push Ukraine into a downward spiral. Now we return to the prospect of a never-ending war. True, Putin has prepared for this. But the scale of recent Russian losses for limited gains, and the embarrassment of not being able to stop Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, means that he still lacks an obvious route to victory.

Even if Trump wins the presidential election in November, that does not guarantee Putin a satisfactory outcome. Trump will want to push his peace plan but, from what has been reported, Putin will find the details as unacceptable as will Zelenskyy.

What would a Trump presidency mean for Ukraine? A lot of the speculation about a potential ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù of the country centres on a possible cut-off in arms supplies, linked to the acceptance of Russian annexation of chunks of Ukrainian territory.

Territory and weaponry are both key questions. But another less discussed issue is also emerging as a vital topic: Ukrainian neutrality.

Senator JD Vance, Trump‚Äôs running mate for the presidency, came out in favour of a neutral Ukraine in an interview with the New York Times in June. Vance said that his approach would be to ‚Äúguarantee both Kyiv‚Äôs independence but also its neutrality . . . Neutrality is clearly something that they [the Russians] see as existential for them.‚Äù

On the surface, a neutral Ukraine sounds like an interesting option. Finland and Austria were neutral during the cold war. Both countries managed to remain democratic and outside the Soviet bloc.

However, the Biden administration remains wary of Russia‚Äôs demand for a neutral Ukraine, believing that Vladimir Putin‚Äôs ambitions would not stop there. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told me last week: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that what Russia wants now is a neutered Ukraine that cannot properly defend itself. He still wants to subjugate Ukraine. And we will not let that happen.‚Äù

Russian hopes to neuter Ukraine became clear in the peace proposals put forward by Moscow in 2022, early in the conflict. They insisted Ukraine should not join Nato ‚Äî and that Ukraine‚Äôs army should be reduced to 85,000 troops and its number of tanks severely limited. One senior Ukrainian official recalls: ‚ÄúThey were asking that we put our weapons into warehouses that they would guard. And for a complete veto over our foreign policy.‚Äù

There is no indication that Russia has backed down from these maximalist demands. The Ukrainians know that accepting Putin‚Äôs proposals would put their country permanently at Moscow‚Äôs mercy. But the current debate about neutrality is still interesting, because it sheds light on arguments about how to end the war in Ukraine that are taking place just beneath the surface of the public discussions.

Much of the public argument still revolves around the vital and emotive question of territory. Russia continues to insist that it will hang on to all the territory that it currently occupies ‚Äî and also that Ukraine must make further troop withdrawals, followed by an international agreement that Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions are Russian territory. Ukraine continues to insist on the complete restoration of its territorial integrity, including Crimea. The US and its European allies say they will support Ukraine for ‚Äúas long at it takes‚Äù and that they will not impose peace terms on the Ukrainians.

Wars are unpredictable, so a decisive battlefield breakthrough by either Ukraine or Russia remains possible. But, as things stand, it is unlikely that Kyiv will be able to take back all its territory by force of arms. The Ukrainians and their main western backers know this, even if they will not acknowledge it in public. Making territorial concessions in return for peace is gaining some support among the Ukrainian public, although it is not yet a majority position.

The biggest obstacle to peace is not Ukraine‚Äôs deep reluctance to make territorial concessions ‚Äî real though that is. It is the fact that Russia would still demand a settlement that involved the subjugation of the 80 per cent of Ukraine that it did not control. The Ukrainians need assurances that Russia would not use a peace settlement to rearm and then go back on the offensive. Until they get that, there is no possibility of a serious debate in Kyiv about borders or territory.

That is why security guarantees for Ukraine would be central to any future peace talks. Kyiv‚Äôs current stance is that Ukraine must join Nato ‚Äî which would mean that the country was covered by the alliance‚Äôs collective security guarantee. The most recent Nato summit declared that ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äôs future is in Nato‚Äù. But it added that this will only happen ‚Äúwhen allies agree and conditions are met‚Äù.

Admitting Ukraine to Nato, while Russia still occupies some of the country‚Äôs territory, would be tricky. West Germany during the cold war could be a model. But West German membership of Nato was backed by the stationing of significant numbers of US troops on West German soil. There is no guarantee that the US Congress would agree to deploy American troops in Ukraine.

Another idea that has powerful advocates in Washington is the ‚ÄúIsrael option‚Äù (sometimes called the porcupine option), which would avoid a formal treaty commitment to defend Ukraine ‚Äî and instead rely on building up Ukraine with advanced western military aid, so that it could deter future Russian aggression on its own.

But even the porcupine option would fall foul of Russia‚Äôs demand for a neutered Ukraine. Could Moscow‚Äôs stance change? The Russians are suffering staggering losses, estimated at over 1,000 troops killed or wounded every day.

But Putin seems to be waiting on events in America. The Biden administration will not agree to the neutering of Ukraine. But a Trump-Vance administration might. As long as the US election result remains in doubt, Putin has every incentive to keep fighting.",1bkysju

Ukraine‚Äôs military said it had captured a key gas transit point supplying Europe as Kyiv pursued its most ambitious incursion into Russian territory in a decade of war, forcing Moscow to declare a state of emergency in two regions.

The unexpected offensive, which raged into a fourth day on Friday, is the largest attack by Kyiv‚Äôs forces on Russian soil, not only since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but at least since the Kremlin‚Äôs covert invasion of Crimea and the Donbas 10 years ago.

The assault aims to divert Russia‚Äôs troops from the east, expose its weaknesses and strengthen Kyiv‚Äôs position in future negotiations with Moscow, said an adviser to the government, after months of Russian gains on the more than 1,000km-long front of the grinding war within Ukraine.

Late on Friday, in the first Ukrainian public confirmation of the incursion, a military brigade published a video of its soldiers at the office of Russian state energy group Gazprom at the Sudzha gas measuring station, a crucial transit post for gas supplies to Europe.

‚ÄúSudzha is under the full control of Ukrainian troops,‚Äù said the 61st mechanised brigade on Telegram. Gas prices in Russia rose sharply to an annual peak, said a Gazprom representative on Telegram.",1bkysju

Russia has been secretly acquiring sensitive goods in India and explored building facilities in the country to secure components for its war effort, according to Russian state correspondence seen by the Financial Times.

Moscow‚Äôs industry and trade ministry, which oversees defence production to support Vladimir Putin‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drew up confidential plans in October 2022 to spend about Rs82bn ($1bn at the time) on securing critical electronics through channels hidden from western governments.

The plan, revealed in letters to a shadowy trade promotion body with strong links to the Russian security services, aimed to use ‚Äúsignificant reserves‚Äù of rupees amassed by Russian banks from booming oil sales to India. It saw India as an alternative market to source crucial goods ‚Äúpreviously supplied from unfriendly countries‚Äù.

Russia and its Indian partners targeted dual-use technologies ‚Äî goods with both civilian and military applications ‚Äî that are subject to western export controls, according to the documents, as well as western officials and two businessmen formerly involved in the trade. Moscow even envisaged pumping investment into Russo-Indian electronics development and production facilities, according to the leaked files.

The correspondence shows how Russia turned to New Delhi, even as Narendra Modi, the prime minister, brought the world‚Äôs most populous country closer than ever into the US orbit.

Patrick Wintour writes that it is the UK‚Äôs biggest spending pledge since Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion in 2022. In January, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, pledged ¬£2.5bn in military aid to Ukraine for 2024-25.

Cameron said: ‚ÄúUkraine has the right to strike inside Russia because Russia is striking inside Ukraine ‚Ä¶ You can understand why Ukraine feels the need to defend itself.‚Äù The foreign secretary announced that the UK‚Äôs donation of military equipment would include precision-guided bombs, air defence missiles and equipment for 100 mobile air defence teams to shoot down Russia‚Äôs drones and missiles.

The UK also committed to doubling its domestic munitions production by investing a further ¬£10bn over the next 10 years. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just emptied all we can in terms of giving equipment,‚Äù said Cameron. ‚ÄúSome of the equipment is actually arriving in Ukraine today while I am here.‚Äù

Emmanuel Macron has said the question of sending western troops to Ukraine would ‚Äúlegitimately‚Äù arise if Russia broke through Ukrainian frontlines and Kyiv made such a request. In an interview with the Economist, the French president maintained his stance of strategic ambiguity, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out.‚Äù

At least eight children were injured in the town of Derhachi in Ukraine‚Äôs north-eastern Kharkiv region on Thursday when Russian guided bombs struck a site close to a sports complex where they had been training, local officials said. An elderly man was also wounded.

Russia said on Thursday it had captured the village of Berdychi which lies about 12km (7 miles) north-west of Avdiivka ‚Äì a week after Ukrainian forces pulled out. Over the weekend, Ukraine‚Äôs commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrsky, said troops had retreated from Berdychi and two other nearby villages to protect ‚Äúthe lives and health of our defenders‚Äù.

Russian energy company Gazprom said on Thursday it suffered a record annual loss in 2023 as the European market was practically shut to its gas exports due to war sanctions.

Engine maker Deutz last week saw its shares jump more than 20 per cent after it said it was looking to build tank engines alongside its motorcycle operations. The engineering group is among those Mittelstand manufacturing and engineering companies reconsidering or ending their ban on defence contracts.

Swaths of German business have long shunned association with the defence sector because of the legacy of industrial co-operation with the Nazi regime. But since February 2022, some key players in the country‚Äôs engineering supply chain, such as laser maker Trumpf and components firm Hawe Hydraulik, have placed military contracts in their sights.

Cathryn Cl√ºver Ashbrook, political scientist and former director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said long-held attitudes around the defence sector were changing rapidly.

The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed on August 6 that Russian border troops and FSB personnel repelled several raids by Ukrainian forces equipped with roughly a battalion's worth of tanks and armored vehicles against Russian positions near Nikolayevo-Darino and Oleshnya, Kursk Oblast (northwest of Sumy City and along the Russia-Ukraine international border).[1] Geolocated footage published on August 6 shows damaged and abandoned armored vehicles roughly seven kilometers north of the international border west of Lyubimovka, Kursk Oblast; Russian sources claimed that the footage shows Ukrainian vehicles, but ISW cannot confirm whether these armored vehicles are Russian, Ukrainian, or both.[2] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces attacked from two directions: from the Sudzha checkpoint (on the border northeast of Sumy City along the H-07/R-200 highways) in the direction of Sudzha and Oleshnya; and from Novehke, Sumy Oblast (northeast of the Sudzha checkpoint and Sumy City) towards Nikolayevo-Darino, Kursk Oblast.[3] The Russian MoD claimed that Russian reserve forces also responded to the supposed Ukrainian raids, and a Russian insider source claimed that elements of the Chechen ""Akhmat"" Spetsnaz also responded to the raids, but ISW cannot verify these claims.[4] The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces destroyed 16 Ukrainian armored vehicles during the supposed raids and that Russian forces conducted retaliatory strikes against Ukrainian positions in Sumy Oblast.[5] Russian milbloggers posted footage claiming to show the aftermath of the supposed Ukrainian raids, although most of the damage shown in the footage appears to be the result of routine Ukrainian shelling and does not indicate that there was ground activity in the area.[6] Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexei Smirnov and several Russian milbloggers warned that fighting is ongoing in the border areas of Kursk Oblast's Sudzhansky and Korenevsky raions, contrary to the Russian MoD's and FSB's reporting.[7]

ISW hasn't posted an update yet, but the raid is quite real, several villages are under Ukrainian control and the town of Sud≈æa has been evacuated.

It's Harkiv incursion in reverse: Russian troops have been making gains in the directions of Pokrovsk and Toreck, so Ukraine is using this raid to force Russia to divert its reserves to a different front.",1bkysju

The chief of Germany‚Äôs largest military contractor Rheinmetall has urged European countries to ditch their preference for national champions and build bigger, more specialised defence groups to compete with US rivals.

Armin Papperger also said in an interview that if Europe wanted closer defence collaboration, countries needed to specialise in different types of military technology.

‚ÄúIt does not make a lot of sense if we, say, pick the second- or third-best technology because one nation wants that‚Äù for nationalistic reasons, he told the Financial Times. ‚ÄúThat is the most difficult discussion they are having at government level.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need big companies in Europe,‚Äù added the 61-year-old Bavarian.

Efforts by EU leaders to beef up defence co-operation have been stymied by the industry‚Äôs fragmentation. European arms companies compete against each other, military budgets are controlled at national level and individual countries are keen to maintain control of strategic supply chains, plants, jobs and technological edge.

One example of successful cross-border co-operation is Europe‚Äôs biggest missile maker MBDA, which is owned by the UK‚Äôs BAE Systems and European aeronautics group Airbus, which each hold a 37.5 per cent stake, with the balance held by Leonardo of Italy.",1bkysju

The US has warned its European allies that China is deepening its support for Russia‚Äôs military-industrial complex with assistance that is both helping its invasion of Ukraine and threatening other countries.

Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, used meetings with EU and Nato foreign ministers this week to warn Beijing was assisting Moscow ‚Äúat a concerning scale‚Äù, and providing ‚Äútools, inputs and technical expertise‚Äù, according to three people familiar with the discussions.

They quoted Blinken as saying the assistance was particularly focused on Russia‚Äôs production of optical equipment and propellants and its space sector, which he said ‚Äúnot only contributes to Russia‚Äôs aggression in Ukraine but threatens other countries‚Äù.

Blinken raised the concerns about China in every session of a meeting of Nato foreign ministers on Wednesday and Thursday, one of the people said.

Its also not one well-supported by history over the previous 120 years.

Indeed the larger force has often lost.

This is because larger numbers of soldiers in and of itself, in industrial and modern warfare, tells you relatively little about the effectiveness of a military force. Its not the numbers of raw soldiers that matters‚Äîits having the right number of soldiers for the equipment you have, training them to use the equipment properly, and motivating and supplying them in the field once they are trained.

If Ukraine did hit Kovrovets with ATACMS, it could mean two things. First, Ukraine has gotten 170-mile M48 or 190-mile M57 ATACMS with 470-pound warheads in addition to getting M39 and M39A1 ATACMs with submunitions.

Second, the M48 and M57 are more accurate than many observers assumed.

The implications are enormous. For starters, what remains of the Black Sea Fleet that‚Äôs still anchoring at Sevastopol, well within range of the M39A1, M48 and M57, is in big trouble. ‚ÄúIf ATACMS are taking out Russian warships in Sevastopol, hard to see the base having much utility left for the Russians,‚Äù pointed out Phillips O‚ÄôBrien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

After all, the frequently-damaged S-400 long-range air defense battery that protects Sevastopol and nearby Belbek air base hasn‚Äôt been able to intercept incoming ATACMS. ‚ÄúRussians have almost no capability to deal with them,‚Äù noted Nuno Felix, a Portuguese military consultant.

Equally troubling for the Russians, accurate ATACMS with unitary warheads could represent a serious danger to the Kerch Bridge, which connects southern Russia to occupied Crimea.

Thales UK, the British subsidiary of the French defence and technology group, is leading the development of the weapon as part of an industrial consortium under contract with the Ministry of Defence. A decision on when and where to deploy the system would be up to the UK government.

At a cost of only 10p per use and with a range of up to 1km, the system will offer a cheaper alternative to traditional missile air defence systems, which typically cost upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The technology can be mounted on military vehicles and uses a mobile power source to produce radio frequency waves or pulses to interfere with the electronics of a moving target.",1bkysju

*Fifty-five Russian soldiers involved in the daily attacks on Ukraine‚Äôs Kharkiv Oblast and its administrative center were identified by the Molfar open-source intelligence (OSINT) agency and named on its website, along with their ranks, home addresses, phone numbers, family information, and passport data.*

*They serve in military unit 45117, based in Voronezh, Russia, where the 47th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment is stationed. This unit regularly receives orders to bomb Kharkiv, including the deadly May 25 strike on the Epicenter hypermarket that killed 19 people, and repeated attacks on nearby Derhachi, Vovchansk, and other settlements in the region.*

*Notable individuals on the list include Oleg Makovetsky, a native of Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast, a Major General and commander of the 6th Army of the Russian Air Force and Air Defense, who gives orders to bomb Ukrainian cities.*

*Colonel Oleksei Loboda, commander of the 47th Bomber Aviation Regiment, is also identified as ordering attacks on residential areas and civilians.*

*The report also mentioned Maksim Krishtop, the deputy commander of the 47th Bomber Aviation Regiment, who was captured and exchanged in 2023, was involved in the strikes.*

*Molfar stressed that everyone on the list, which also names engineers and pilots, including those who carry out attacks with unguided munitions, are involved in ‚Äúnumerous war crimes‚Äù and must face the consequences.

lcn1of7,"A raft of newly published books take for granted that the US and China have entered a new cold war. The conclusion is understandable, especially for policymakers who came of age during that earlier twilight struggle. Once again, a liberal democracy is engaged in a global struggle with a communist dictatorship. Countries everywhere are under pressure to choose sides.

In fact, the historical analogy is wrong. And unless the two rivals recognize that soon, they may fail to repeat the greatest unsung accomplishment of the US-Soviet cold war: avoiding a hot one.

Swayed by the parallels, US and Chinese leaders are adopting similar strategic frameworks and tactics to win what they see as an open-ended contest for power and security. Washington is dusting off its earlier playbook, hoping to contain China through security partnerships and export controls. Following the Soviet approach, China is rapidly building up its nuclear arsenal and its economic and technological self-sufficiency, to defend against trade sanctions and potential embargos.

Those strategic choices are locking the two rivals into a dangerous action-reaction spiral. Perhaps the best example is China‚Äôs fateful decision to form a strategic partnership with Russia in 2022 to counter US moves to strengthen its regional alliance networks, such as AUKUS (a program to equip the Australian navy with the most advanced US nuclear attack submarines). Chinese support has enabled Russian President Vladimir Putin to sustain his war against Ukraine, angering the US and its NATO partners and propelling mistrust of Beijing to new heights.

However compelling these steps may appear to Washington and Beijing, they are repeating the mistakes that marked the real historical parallel to today‚Äôs rivalry: the British-German tensions that led to World War I. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-07-10/us-and-china-rivalry-isn-t-another-cold-war-it-s-worse",1bkysju

The EU is considering indefinitely extending its sanctions on Moscow‚Äôs state assets, in a move that would soothe US concerns over plans to use the proceeds of Russian central bank funds to fund a $50bn loan to Ukraine.

Ambassadors from the 27 member states will meet today to discuss a European Commission proposal for the ‚Äúopen-ended immobilisation of the Central Bank of Russia assets‚Äù, according to a document seen by the Financial Times.

The move, which would apply to the European share of the ‚Ç¨260bn worth of central bank assets immobilised outside of Russia, would ‚Äúprovide G7 partners with the highest degree of predictability‚Äù regarding the repayment of a $50bn loan that leaders of the grouping of advanced economies signed off on last month. The plan is to repay the loans with profits arising from the assets.

At present, sanctions are repeatedly applied every six months, creating concern among the EU‚Äôs allies that the loan will not be fully repaid.

The lack of such predictability has been a big stumbling block in achieving a sign-off on the loan from the US, which wants stronger assurances from Europe that it will keep the ‚Ç¨190bn-worth of assets stuck in Belgium‚Äôs central securities depository Euroclear frozen until the loan is repaid, or Russia agrees to reparations that would cover the cost of borrowing.

The move comes ahead of US elections in November, where leading candidate and former president Donald Trump has called into question continuing aid to Ukraine, spurring G7 allies to maximise support to the war-torn country before year‚Äôs end.",1bkysju

The US has accused China of providing Russia with cruise missile and drone engines and machine tools for ballistic missiles, as it urges Europe to step up diplomatic and economic pressure on Beijing to stop the sales.

In disclosing previously classified intelligence, senior US officials said Chinese and Russian groups were working to jointly produce drones inside Russia. They said China had also supplied 90 per cent of chips imported by Russia last year which were being used to make tanks, missiles and aircraft.

The officials added China was also helping Russia to improve its satellite and other space-based capabilities to help prosecute its war in Ukraine, and Beijing was also providing satellite imagery.

Dennis Wilder, a former top China military analyst at the CIA, said the disclosure ‚Äúfar exceeds previous estimates and shows a concerted programme by China‚Äôs leaders‚Äù to help Moscow prosecute the war in Ukraine.

‚ÄúRussia lost access to critical machine tools from Europe at the beginning of the conflict and China has moved to fill the gap,‚Äù said Wilder, now at Georgetown University.

Wilder said chips were essential for targeting systems and radars and China was also a world leader in drones for military and civilian purposes.

A month into Ukraine‚Äôs incursion into Russian territory, one thing is clear: the Kremlin is ready to continue the war of attrition that Vladimir Putin still believes he can win. Hopes that the conflict can be brought to a swift end by some form of military or economic shortcut have so far been dashed. Now, what started as Putin‚Äôs war is increasingly becoming Russia‚Äôs war, boosting the Kremlin‚Äôs ability to ignore the costs.

It goes without saying that the Kursk debacle is embarrassing for Putin: after all, it‚Äôs the first time nuclear-armed Russia has been invaded since the second world war ‚Äî and by a non-nuclear state to boot. But it remains unlikely that this humiliation will cause political problems for Putin at home, as senior officials in Ukraine and the west have suggested.

Deep reserves of social inertia, apathy and the enforced atomisation of Russian society were the sources of Putin‚Äôs power long before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. And since then, the Kremlin has carefully cultivated these pillars of the regime ‚Äî while at the same time beefing up the apparatus of repression and showering the population with money.

Moreover, in the regions along the border that have witnessed Ukrainian retaliation, support for the Russian war effort is 10-15 per cent higher than the national average of roughly 60 per cent. These are the same regions where, before the war, thousands of people used to visit their Ukrainian relatives and friends across the border. The growth of pro-war sentiment isn‚Äôt necessarily resulting in more army recruits, but it makes the government‚Äôs job of persuading the Russian people to tolerate an open-ended fight with their neighbours easier. 

This is why Putin is in no rush to push back the invader at any cost. His military focus this year has been on eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are gnawing their way through Ukrainian defences. For now, it‚Äôs enough for the Kremlin to patch the breach in the Kursk area by haphazardly scrambling military units from all over Russia while continuing to employ the most combat-ready fighters in the Donbas. The Russian president believes that he needs to advance as far as possible before winter sets in, and that he can afford to deal with Kursk later.

This helps to explain why the Kremlin, despite the embarrassment, is not rushing to use some of the most potent tools at its disposal, including tactical nuclear weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for understandable reasons, wants to portray the incursion into Russia as ultimate proof that the Kremlin can be pushed around by force ‚Äî and that the west shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of escalation. ‚ÄúThe whole naive, illusory concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia which dominated the assessment of the war by some partners, has crumbled,‚Äù he said last month.

The truth is that for every setback in this war, Putin has been able to push back and extort a price from the Ukrainians ‚Äî and, increasingly, from Kyiv‚Äôs western allies. In the last two and a half years he has conducted a large-scale mobilisation, started ruthless air strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure and launched a sabotage campaign in the west. In response to the Kursk incursion, the Kremlin has ordered a massive strike against Ukraine‚Äôs electricity grid, and has continued to terrorise the country every night since.

There will be further painful reversals for Putin in this war, as Kyiv seeks approval from the west to use Nato-supplied long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, as well as developing its own missile programme with western help. But the Kremlin is not short of tools to respond. The most crucial decision right now is whether Putin will attempt a fresh mobilisation, given that Russian troop numbers are depleted.

This manpower shortage can be addressed through an electronic draft summons system that was introduced last year and will be operational by November. After the panic and exodus that followed the partial mobilisation of 2022, the new system is designed to reduce public anxiety and make it impossible for draftees to flee abroad.

Given the determination to fight on in both Moscow and Kyiv, there is unlikely to be a shortcut to a swift victory for either side. With diminished prospects for meaningful diplomacy in the coming months, the war will drag on. It remains unpredictable and is only getting more dangerous. Western leaders should be prepared to stand by Ukraine for a long and painful period.",1bkysju

kzck7al,"Selling more oil at higher prices ought to be the stuff of dreams for a petrostate. But for Russia it is a sign of a new, punishing phase in its war with Ukraine. Months of Ukrainian drone strikes on refineries have crimped Russia‚Äôs ability to produce refined fuels, such as diesel and petrol, and turned the world‚Äôs third-largest oil producer into an importer of petrol. Energy firms have tried to pare their losses by selling unrefined oil overseas, pushing exports to a ten-month high in March.

In Ukraine‚Äôs most recent attack on April 2nd, its planners extended their reach. They managed to land explosives on a refinery 1,115km from the border. Their attack set fire to a unit responsible for 3% of Russia‚Äôs refining capacity. Although it left no lasting damage, others have been more successful. All told, Ukraine‚Äôs barrage has knocked out a seventh of Russian refining capacity, according to S&P Global, a data firm. Maintenance work and flooding in the city of Orsk on April 8th has taken more capacity offline. Wholesale prices on the St Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange have spiked. Ukraine, which has itself been the target of strikes on energy infrastructure, hopes the assaults will slow the flow of dollars into its enemy‚Äôs war machine and dent support for the war.

Russia‚Äôs oil giants are suffering the most. Refineries that normally produce petrol and diesel for overseas clients at a premium have been diverted to domestic production. The volume of diesel due to pass out of Russian ports has hit a five-month low. At the same time, oil barons are seeking new customers for their excess crude, on which they will stomach losses of $15 or so for every barrel that could have been exported as a refined product, says Sergey Vakulenko, a former oil executive.

Although Ukraine‚Äôs attacks have slowed since Vladimir Putin‚Äôs re-election in March, Ukraine has given no indication that they will stop. It can lob drones faster and more cheaply than Russia can repair its refineries. Some facilities, like the NORSI refinery in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, have been particularly slow and expensive to fix, in part because access to equipment is stymied by Western sanctions. As of this month, Russian oil producers must also reduce the amount they pump from the ground by about 5% as part of a production cap agreed with OPEC+, an oil cartel.

Motorists have so far been shielded from Ukraine-inflicted ‚Äúunplanned maintenance‚Äù (as Russia‚Äôs energy ministry puts it). The government has kept a lid on prices by banning petrol exports for six months from March 1st, and striking a deal with Belarus, its client state. Russia imported 3,000 tonnes of fuel from Belarus in the first half of March, up from zero in January. Fearing that may not be enough, officials have also asked neighbouring Kazakhstan to set aside a third of its reserves, equivalent to 100,000 tonnes, should Russia need them, according to Reuters. If attacks continue, they could start to push up prices.

The consequences for Russia‚Äôs public finances should be limited, even though oil revenues represent 34% of its budget. Rosneft, the state oil company, will dispense a smaller dividend if it cannot make up its lost revenues, but many doubt these dividends make it to state coffers at all. The government will even save some cash by paying out fewer per-barrel subsidies to refineries. Russia‚Äôs biggest money-earners are resource taxes. And because these are levied as royalties at the well-head, the government is indifferent between oil exported as crude or as refined fuel, says Mr Vakulenko. As long as Russia is able to export crude, it can collect royalties.

Observers outside Russia are watching to see if Ukraine‚Äôs attacks will affect the global oil market. They have yet to have much impact, but the price of Brent crude has risen by 19% this year to just under $90 a barrel, owing to OPEC+ supply curbs, better-than-expected global economic conditions and disruptions in the Red Sea. Few observers have more at stake than Joe Biden, who faces an election in November. His administration has urged Ukraine to halt its attacks, fearing they will provoke tough retaliation from Russia and drive petrol prices higher.

America is planning to send $61bn to Ukraine in total. The vast majority of that will be spent on lethal aid by replenishing American military stockpiles, allowing more to be given away, and procuring new weapons and ammunition from American arms firms. The first priority is desperately needed shells. An American three-star general has already been assigned the job of organising arms deliveries, subject to the vote. The Pentagon should be able to start getting shells to Ukraine within two weeks, reckons Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank, and can supply enough to last for a year or so. Larger weapons systems will take much longer to ship; some still need to be ordered, let alone manufactured. The hope is that it will be enough to fend off a larger-scale Russian offensive that Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine‚Äôs military-intelligence service, has said he expects in June.

Ukraine has other looming problems, though. Its stock of air-defence interceptor missiles, fired from a mix of American, European and Soviet-era launchers, has dwindled. Russian attack jets have recently been providing close air support to troops with seemingly little risk of being shot down. America‚Äôs Patriot missile-defence systems are in high demand elsewhere, including Israel, and production is low. At the same time, Russia is deploying effective new weapons. On April 11th it successfully launched an attack on a thermal power station in Kyiv using a Kh-69 stealth cruise missile that eluded a Patriot interceptor. Even with enough kit, Ukraine confronts a serious manpower disadvantage compared with Russia.

Moscow‚Äôs trade volumes with key partners such as Turkey and China have slumped in the first quarter of this year after the US targeted international banks helping Russia acquire critical products to aid its war effort.

A US executive order, implemented late last year, prompted lenders to drop Russian counterparties and avoid transactions in a range of currencies, said western officials and three senior Russian financiers.

Ukraine‚Äôs Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said more than 30bn hryvnia (about $800mn) has been allocated to building fortifications this year.

But construction only began ramping up in February, around the time Colonel General Oleksandr Syrsky was appointed as new commander-in-chief of the armed forces and announced that Ukraine had moved from offensive actions to ‚Äúactive defence‚Äù.

This new strategy means Kyiv seeks to hold its ground while still probing for weak spots such as using long-range air missiles and drones to strike the Russian Black Sea fleet and oil refineries deep within Russia. 

Western officials told the Financial Times last month the ‚Äúactive defence‚Äù strategy would also allow Ukraine to build up its forces this year and prepare for 2025, when it might have a better chance at a counteroffensive.

These new defences are similar to Russia‚Äôs fortifications built in late 2022 and early 2023 that thwarted Ukraine‚Äôs much-vaunted counteroffensive.

NATO commanders also indicated that Russian forces are preparing for a longer-term war effort, however. Cavoli stated that Russian forces have improved in some unspecified areas but failed to improve in others, but that the Russian military has proven that it is a learning organization.[19] NATO Military Committee Chairperson Lieutenant Admiral Rob Bauer stated that the Russian defense industrial base (DIB) is more efficient than the Western DIB but that Russian forces still struggle with troop quality and training, all consistent with ISW's longstanding assessments about Russia's attempts to sustain its long-term war effort amid short to medium-term struggles with manpower and materiel.[20]

Russia launched almost 90 drones against Ukraine in one of its largest attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

The overnight attack, which lasted for seven hours and well into Wednesday morning, mainly targeted Kyiv where more than 30 drones were shot down, according to Ukraine‚Äôs air defence forces.

It marked an escalation in Russia‚Äôs renewed offensive, which has prompted Ukrainian forces to also increase their aerial attacks on Russian targets.

Kyiv city administration head Serhiy Popko described it as ‚Äúone of the most massive drone attacks on Ukraine during the entire war‚Äù, while noting that none reached their targets. Authorities said 13 houses in the Kyiv region were hit by falling debris and the rest of the drones were downed outside of residential areas.

Explosions were reported in four other Ukrainian regions ‚Äî Mykolayiv, Dnipro, Sumy and Poltava.

It was the first nationwide attack since July 8, when Russian missiles overpowered Kyiv‚Äôs air defences, killing 42 people and injuring 190 in an attack on a children‚Äôs hospital and several residential buildings.

Russian drone attacks on Kyiv have become rare since 2023 when Ukraine built up strong air defences around the capital, which include US-made Patriot systems.

Ukrainian drone strikes in Russia have also intensified, with several reported over the past week. On Wednesday, Kyiv‚Äôs forces claimed to have hit a weapons depot in the Kursk region near the Ukrainian border. The Russian defence ministry said its forces destroyed 19 drones launched by Ukraine overnight.

On Sunday, Ukraine said its drones had damaged two Tu-22M3 bomber planes at an airfield in Murmansk, in the far north of Russia.

Ukrainian forces most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims about Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast, however.

""The situation on the Pokrovsk front is fairly difficult ... the enemy is using its advantage in personnel, weapons and military equipment, it is actively using artillery and aviation,"" he said.

Moscow's troops were trying to counterattack in the area and encircle Kyiv's forces, but those attempts were being repelled, he added.

Ukrainian forces crashed through Russia's western border into the Kursk region on Aug. 6 in a surprise offensive that is continuing.

While Kyiv has said it has no intention of annexing the area it has captured, Ukrainian troops are building defensive lines and it appears that they intend to retain ""some of that territory for some period of time,"" Cohen told the Intelligence and National Security Summit.
""We can be certain that Putin will mount a counteroffensive to try to reclaim that territory,"" Cohen said. ""I think our expectation is that that will be a difficult fight for the Russians.""
Putin, he said, ""is not only going to have to face the fact that there is a front line now within Russian territory that he's going to have to deal with, he has to deal with reverberations back in his own society that they have lost a piece of Russian territory.""

Ukraine's success in Kursk ""has the potential to change the dynamic"" of the conflict ""a little bit going forward,"" he continued without elaborating.

The US is warning countries trading with Russia that they risk secondary sanctions if they allow Russian banks to set up local branches to finance the supply of goods for Vladimir Putin‚Äôs war machine.

The move is aimed at closing workarounds that Russia has used to circumvent sanctions, notably by finding obscure means to pay for dual-use goods needed to make arms for its invasion of Ukraine.

Wally Adeyemo, US deputy Treasury secretary, told the Financial Times that Washington was now prepared to pursue countries that let Russian banks set up branches in their jurisdictions to evade western sanctions ‚Äî even if the bank itself was not under sanction.

‚ÄúWe will go after the branch they‚Äôre setting up, but also the other entities and the companies in your jurisdiction that work with them,‚Äù Adeyemo said.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt only a warning toward doing business with subsidiaries or branches of an already sanctioned institution,‚Äù he added, saying countries should stop any Russian branch or subsidiary from being established ‚Äúsince it is going to be used to circumvent the sanctions that our coalition has put in place‚Äù.

The measures are the latest in a series of rule changes designed to frustrate Russia‚Äôs imports of sensitive war-related goods by making banks across the world wary of becoming involved in the financing of the trade.

An executive order released by the White House in December 2023 warned foreign financial institutions that they were at risk of secondary sanctions if they conducted or facilitated transactions related to the Russian military-industrial complex. The entities covered were broadened in June to cover any sanctioned Russian entity.

The threat has been credited with causing significant problems for Russia in financing the import of sensitive items. Official trade data shows that exports from China and Turkey to Russia of the most critical war-related goods fell dramatically following the order.

Exports from China of so-called ‚Äúhigh-priority‚Äô‚Äù goods, a set of exports that the US and its allies have made particular efforts to stop, dropped from $421mn in December to $212mn in February.

Adeyemo said Russia had continued to struggle to find payment channels for the goods after recent US sanctions against companies such as VTB Bank Shanghai, the only representative office of a Russian bank in China, which the US blacklisted in June.

Speaking after the US decision, Andrei Kostin, VTB‚Äôs chief executive, admitted Russia was struggling to find new loopholes before the US managed to close them.

‚ÄúWe have noticed that whatever steps we take, the western reaction is very quick,‚Äù Kostin said at a conference in July. ‚ÄúAs soon as we do anything anywhere, a delegation of 10 people arrives and starts beating the local authorities over the head to stop us.‚Äù

Kostin said ‚Äúthe situation is getting worse every day, but we are still solving it, and goods are flowing‚Äù.

Adeyemo said the US was shifting its focus to smaller banks in new countries after an earlier round of pressure prompted bigger lenders in countries such as China, Turkey and the UAE to drop Russian counterparties.

Russia is making efforts to set up alternative payment systems, strong enough to resist western pressure, with countries such as China and Iran that share its resentment of US financial dominance.

Chinese premier Li Qiang and Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin pledged to ‚Äúensure that settlement channels function seamlessly and properly‚Äù after a meeting in Moscow on Thursday. This includes using the renminbi and rouble for more transactions, opening more correspondent accounts in their respective countries, and supporting closer ties between their financial systems.

But Adeyemo said the west‚Äôs dominance of global finance meant most major banks caved in under the western pressure. ‚ÄúThey do far more business with the US, the EU, the UK and the rest of our coalition than they do with Russia,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to lose access to the dollar, the euro, the pound or the yen.‚Äù",1bkysju

Ivanishvili notably omitted any mention of Russia and Russian aggression against Georgia. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgian Dream would hold UNM, particularly former pro-Western Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, accountable should Georgia Dream obtain a constitutional majority in the upcoming October 2024 Georgian parliamentary elections. 

Ivanishvili also stated that the Georgian government, under the Georgian Deam party, would seek reconciliation with South Ossetia and work towards forgiveness for the alleged violence that UNM caused. Ivanishvili‚Äôs rhetoric closely echoes the larger Georgian Dream election campaign that seeks to present itself as the party of peace while framing opposition parties, such as UNM, as parties supporting instability and war.[28] 

ISW previously assessed that Georgian Dream has used narratives that closely mirror Kremlin information operations aimed at justifying Russian aggression against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states that the Russian Empire and Soviet Union formerly colonized by blaming domestic, pro-Western parties who allegedly cooperate with unspecified ‚Äúexternal actors‚Äù to instigate violence. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-14-2024",1bkysju

After Congress approved a long-delayed $61bn in US military aid to Ukraine this week, Russia gloated that advanced western weapons would not turn the tide on the battlefield.

More than at any point since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine two years ago, Russia‚Äôs president appears ‚Äúvery self-assured and happy‚Äù in recent months, said a person who knows him well. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if the military aid changes that.‚Äù

While Ukraine was running out of western aid and struggled to rotate its exhausted troops, Russia took advantage of its superior firepower and manpower and made incremental advances across the front line.

Two senior Ukrainian intelligence officials described Russia‚Äôs current attacks along key areas of the frontline and missile and drones strikes on Kharkiv and similarly important cities as softening the battlefield before a bigger offensive operation.

The officials said they expected Russia to launch a new large-scale offensive in late May or June.

But with US aid finally on the way, Ukraine could expose the flaws inherent in Russia‚Äôs attempts to overwhelm it with low-quality munitions and a large but poorly trained army, according to western defence officials and analysts.

One western official said that while Russia might make some tactical breakthroughs at the frontline, it remained an ineffective army characterised by old equipment and poorly trained soldiers and would not ‚Äúoverrun‚Äù Ukraine, they added.

‚ÄúIn February 2022, Russia had a far better equipped and trained army,‚Äù the official said, referring to Russia‚Äôs initial invasion and subsequent rout in northern Ukraine. ‚ÄúI simply can‚Äôt see that it is better now.‚Äù

After its initial blitzkrieg failed, Russia has sought to grind down Ukraine by favouring quantity over quality on the battlefield.

Russia fires five shells for each returning salvo from Ukraine‚Äôs forces, while the ratio is even higher in some flashpoints along the line of contact, according to Dara Massicot, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies the Russian military.

‚ÄúThe aid won‚Äôt cancel out Russian advantages this year, but it will allow Ukrainian forces to defend their positions with counter-battery fires and can be used to slow or halt Russian advances,‚Äù Massicot said.


Boosted by a record Rbs10.8tn ($118.5bn) in spending on defence this year ‚Äî six per cent of gross domestic product ‚Äî Russia‚Äôs arms industry has built up production several times over, with factories working around the clock, according to officials.

Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, the state defence conglomerate, last November said Russia is making 2.5 times more artillery and multiple launch systems as before, while increasing production of some types of ammunition by more than 60 times.

Those sheer numbers, however, mask Moscow‚Äôs inability to turn that firepower into a significant breakthrough ‚Äî something Russian experts say it could only do with more advanced weaponry.

Western sanctions have made it harder for Russia to obtain the components needed for drones, loitering munitions, guided bombs, and high-precision missiles, forcing it to rely on the lower-tech weapons it can mass-produce more easily, according to Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow defence think-tank.

Pukhov said: ‚ÄúThe most decisive systems on the battlefield in Ukraine are directly dependent on sanctions. Scaling them up means leaders on all levels have to think creatively and understand the main trends and likely outcomes of the war.‚Äù

Despite Moscow‚Äôs larger arsenal, its army ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have a radical advantage over Ukraine in artillery and munitions‚Äù, he added. ‚ÄúAt least, the people fighting on the Russian side don‚Äôt see it.‚Äù

Instead, the Kremlin is deploying more low-tech weaponry such as highly destructive glide bombs and refurbished Soviet weaponry while deploying troops using motorcycles and off-road vehicles.

‚ÄúIf it works, it works ‚Äî low-tech or not,‚Äù Massicot said.

Even that, however, is not enough to sustain the enormous rates of fire Russia rained down on Ukraine in the first six months of the war, according to Pavel Luzin, non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, based in Washington.

Russia fired up to 60,000 shells a day before autumn 2022 ‚Äî an amount that has dropped to about 10,000 a day and which includes supplies from North Korea and Iran.

Those smaller rates of fire reflect how the intensity of battle is outstripping what Russia can replenish even at those higher production levels ‚Äî and holding back a more significant push forward.

Russia would need to produce 3.6mn shells a year to sustain the current rate of fire, according to a report published this week by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The defence ministry has admitted, however, it can only produce at most half of the 4mn 152mm-caliber shells and 1.6mn 122mm-caliber shells Putin‚Äôs military estimates it needs to break through.

And as Russia keeps firing more shells, it wears down its artillery barrels faster than it can produce new ones ‚Äî forcing it to replace them with Soviet-era barrels instead.

The US aid does not address what Ukrainian and western officials say is Kyiv‚Äôs most glaring problem ‚Äî an inability to match the enormous numbers of men Russia has called up to fight.

Christopher Cavoli, Nato‚Äôs supreme allied commander for Europe, told lawmakers in a Senate armed services committee hearing in April that Russia is recruiting 30,000 soldiers per month, taking its frontline troops from 360,000 a year ago to 470,000.

To raise those men, the army is offering financial incentives including salaries starting at Rbs200,000 ‚Äî five times the average wage in some of Russia‚Äôs poorer regions ‚Äî and bonuses ranging between Rbs300,000 and Rbs1mn, according to a report by Estonia‚Äôs foreign intelligence service.

Soldiers can receive further bonuses for their exploits on the battlefield or being wounded, while their families stand to receive generous payouts if they are killed in action.

Those prospects are not distant: 315,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the war, Cavoli said, adding pressure for the army to replenish its units.

That mercantile approach allows Russia to draw enough recruits from people for whom fighting is financially attractive while avoiding mobilisation ‚Äî a step that prompted hundreds of thousands of men to flee the country in the fall of 2022.

‚ÄúThe main approach now is ‚Äòpurchasing blood‚Äô among the Russian lower classes,‚Äù said Luzin, from the Center for European Policy Analysis.

A summer offensive, however, would require Putin to declare another round of mobilisation, said Massicot of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

‚ÄúIf the Kremlin has ambitions for Kharkiv, or something even more difficult like southern Ukraine, then they will need to generate a very large force, probably well over 100,000 for both, plus the equipment,‚Äù Massicot said.

Even if Russia did draft more men, sheer numbers would not be sufficient to compensate for their lack of training, Luzin said. ‚ÄúWe all talk about mobilisation but where are the commanders, sergeants and lieutenants, who would command the mobilised soldiers?‚Äù",1bkysju

Similar to Chechnya, DNR and LNR, Russia will conscript everyone who can hold a gun using its repressive apparatus, and will certainly not leave out former AFU soldiers. Faced with a choice between death for themselves and their loved ones or working for the Russian Federation, people will have no chance to refuse. In addition, Russia will get its hands on the entire developing military-industrial complex of Ukraine together with all the specialists and developments. With such military potential and nuclear weapons, Russia will be unstoppable.

Nato leaders are expected to make a one-year, ‚Ç¨40bn pledge of support for Ukraine this week, as the alliance‚Äôs most important members are engulfed in domestic political turmoil that limits their capacity to commit more long-term resources to Ukraine in its defence against Russia.

The summit starting on Tuesday in Washington comes on the heels of a snap election in France, where talks over a new government are expected to be complex and where the Ukraine-sceptic far right has become a major political force, and as Joe Biden faces pressure to quit the US presidential race against Donald Trump. In Germany, the coalition of Chancellor Olaf Scholz remains unpopular and fragile.

These tectonic shifts have undermined Nato‚Äôs efforts to cast the alliance‚Äôs 75th anniversary as a show of unwavering support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Instead the event risks shining a light on the fragility of continued western aid for Kyiv.

‚ÄúOf course, in democracies we can never provide guarantees. We don‚Äôt live in that world. But we live in a world of maximising good outcomes and minimising bad outcomes,‚Äù Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of Nato, said ahead of the summit.

* Russia's revenues for the first quarter jumped over 50% to $94 billion. Earnings rose due to higher oil prices and increased taxes. Russia has a lot more room to increase its revenues as rest of the world trade openly with Russia while there is virtually zero domestic opposition to any tax moves (or, to any policy changes for that matter)
* Meanwhile, the West is unable and/or unwilling to use the frozen assets to help Ukraine. The ‚Ç¨200 billion are simply standing idle while the EU is extremely slow to reach an agreement on even the few billions of profits.
* EU's governments are shifting once again to far-right/alt-right, as displayed by Slovakia, meaning the already ultra-slow process to achieve important agreements to help Ukraine may soon grind to complete halt.
* No progress on US aid for months and no light at the of the tunnel either. Meanwhile, there are rumours that Trump's ""secret plan"" to achieve ""peace"" is... for Ukraine to surrender. The West's most powerful country may simply give up on backing up democracies and fatally weaken its own alliance (aka NATO's East Wing) on incredibly immature ideas.

The West has now pretty much frozen in fear and internal bickering, only fueling Putin's actions further and proving that despite his Ukraine-3-days plans failing, his bets on West's fragility were justified.

Since Russia launched its full scale invasion, we have provided Ukraine with 15 military equipment support packages.   
This includes air defense systems, combat vehicles, main battle tanks, Archer artillery, anti-tank weapons, combat boats, and mine clearance equipment.   
Ukraine is also Sweden's single largest recipient of bilateral development assistance and once Ukraine is Victorious, Sweden will be there to help rebuild your country. Today we're taking another step: Sweden's government, together with our cooperating party in Parliament, have agreed on a new framework for long-term support to Ukraine, comprising a total of 6.5 billion EUR or 75 billion Swedish Kroner in Military Support to Ukraine from 2024 to 2026: this support will help fund long-term donations of additional military material and the purchasing of new material for direct supply from the defense sector to Ukraine.

Gazprom is unlikely to recover gas sales lost as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for at least a decade, according to a report commissioned for the Russian energy group‚Äôs leaders.

The company‚Äôs exports to Europe will average 50bn-75bn cubic metres a year by 2035, barely a third of prewar levels, the research predicted.

Although Gazprom is hoping that a new pipeline to China can help make up for lost European export volumes, its capacity will only be 50 bcm a year and prices in the Asian nation are much lower than in Europe, the report said, while a deal over its construction has yet to be reached.

lanv0g4,"Russia‚Äôs Victory Day offensive across Ukraine‚Äôs northern border with Russia may have aimed to capture a wide, deep swathe of territory to bring heavy artillery closer to the city of Kharkiv, 25 miles to the south. More ambitiously, Russian commanders may have hoped to march on Kharkiv itself.

Neither happened. Within a couple of weeks of the offensive kicking off on May 9‚Äîthe day Russia celebrates its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II‚Äîthe force of 30,000 or so Russian troops got bogged down in the town of Vovchansk, just a few miles south of the border.

And now the defenders of Vovchansk, including some or part of several Ukrainian mechanized, marine and airborne brigades, have reportedly defeated an elite Russian airborne brigade.

According to a well-regarded Ukrainian correspondent who writes under the pseudonym ‚ÄúNikolaev Vanek,‚Äù the 83rd Airborne Brigade has retreated from Vovchansk after a costly three-week deployment.

‚ÄúThe entire 83rd Airborne Brigade is urgently withdrawn to the rear to restore combat capability,‚Äù Vanek wrote. ‚ÄúThere are too many casualties, they can't fight, there are too many 500s.‚Äù

In Russian military parlance, a ‚Äúcode 500‚Äù is a soldier who refuses to fight. 

If confirmed, it‚Äôs a stinging loss for the new Russian northern grouping of forces, which includes around seven regiments and brigades. And Russian losses in Vovchansk could get a lot worse, as the survivors of an entire battalion‚Äîthat‚Äôs hundreds of troops‚Äîhave been trapped in a chemical plant in central Vovchansk for two weeks.

The trapped soldiers might not last much longer. The Ukrainian air force has been lobbing precision glide bombs at the chemical plant, gradually reducing it to rubble.

The 83rd Airborne Brigade is, or was, an elite force‚Äîone of a dozen or so brigade-sized formations in the 40,000-person pre-war airborne corps. As recently as 2019, the brigade practiced parachuting into combat with their lightweight armored vehicles.

In Ukraine, the 83rd Airborne Brigade ditched its parachutes and fought as a mechanized force in its tracked BMD and wheeled BTR vehicles. Redeploying hundreds of miles at a time to respond to Ukrainian attacks and opportunities for Russian attacks, the brigade fought in the south in 2023 and, this spring, took part in the Russian siege of the eastern town of Chasiv Yar.

As the Victory Day offensive ground to a halt in Vovchansk, Russian commanders ordered the 83rd Airborne Brigade to head north and get the northern grouping of forces moving again.

The first 83rd Airborne Brigade paratroopers appeared along the front line in Vovchansk before June 12. On or around June 16, the Russian northern grouping of forces ‚Äúused 17 paratroopers from the 83rd Brigade,‚Äù recalled a Ukrainian drone operator with the call sign ‚ÄúKriegsforscher.‚Äù

The Ukrainian 82nd Air Assault Brigade targeted the Russian paratroopers with mortars, killing four and wounding 10, according to Kriegsforscher.

It was a disastrous start for the 83rd Airborne Brigade in Vovchansk. Incredibly, the brigade doubled down. ‚ÄúFirstly, they deployed one assault battalion from the 83rd Brigade,‚Äù Kriegsforscher noted. ‚ÄúIt suffered losses and they deployed the rest of the brigade.‚Äù

Conditions were brutal for the Russian paratroopers. ‚ÄúWe can't take it anymore!‚Äù a paratrooper reportedly named Oleg Vesnin moaned in a video he recorded on his phone around June 12. ‚ÄúThree days without food and water. No support. I don't know what to do next.‚Äù Two of his fellow troopers lay wounded, if not dead, behind him.

Two weeks later, the 83rd Airborne Brigade had suffered so many losses among its approximately 2,000 pre-war personnel‚Äîincluding troopers who allegedly refused to fight‚Äîthat it was no longer capable of major combat, if Vanek‚Äôs reporting is accurate.

The unit had no choice but to withdraw from the battlefield. ‚ÄúBye bye,‚Äù Vanek quipped. He wrote that he expected a similar fate for whichever Russian unit replaces the 83rd Airborne Brigade in a battle that is rapidly becoming a trap for Russian infantry.

The type of Russian missile that destroyed a Kyiv children‚Äôs hospital relies on western-designed components, according to experts and Ukrainian officials, showing the Kremlin‚Äôs success at evading sanctions.

Captured on camera a second before it hit the cancer hospital on Monday, the Kh-101 is one of Russia‚Äôs most advanced cruise missiles and critical to its intensifying air strike campaign against Ukraine.

Russia is making nearly eight times more Kh-101s than before President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 ‚Äî and is still dependent on parts from western countries, particularly the US.

lci5tr5,"Russia is unlikely to make significant territorial gains in Ukraine in the coming months as its poorly trained forces struggle to break through Ukrainian defenses that are now reinforced with Western munitions, U.S. officials say.

Through the spring and early summer, Russian troops tried to take territory outside the city of Kharkiv and renew a push in eastern Ukraine, to capitalize on their seizure of Avdiivka. Russia has suffered thousands of casualties in the drive while gaining little new territory.

Russia‚Äôs problems represent a significant change in the dynamic of the war, which had favored Moscow in recent months. Russian forces continue to inflict pain, but their incremental advances have been slowed by the Ukrainians‚Äô hardened lines.

The months ahead will not be easy for Ukraine. But allied leaders gathering in Washington this week for the 75th anniversary of the founding of North Atlantic Treaty Organization can legitimately argue that their efforts to strengthen Ukraine are working.

‚ÄúUkrainian forces are stretched thin and face difficult months of fighting ahead, but a major Russian breakthrough is now unlikely,‚Äù said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who recently visited Ukraine. 

While Russia is not in a position to seize large parts of Ukraine, the prospects of Kyiv retaking more land from the invading army are also waning. Prodded by American advisers, Ukraine is focused on building up its defenses and striking deep behind Russian lines.

Eric Ciaramella, a former intelligence official who is now an expert on Ukraine working with Mr. Kofman at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it had become clear over the past 18 months that neither Russia nor Ukraine ‚Äúpossesses the capabilities to significantly change the battle lines.‚Äù

The United States, Mr. Ciaramella said, has always defined its strategic objective ‚Äúas a Ukraine that is democratic, prosperous, European and secure.‚Äù The United States and its allies will need to make long-term investments to enable Ukraine to hold its lines, wear out Russia and do damage, according to Mr. Ciaramella and current U.S. officials.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a highly unstable scenario,‚Äù Mr. Ciaramella said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Western leaders also really need to focus on integrating Ukraine into European and trans-Atlantic security structures.‚Äù

The European Union agreed last month to begin membership negotiations with Ukraine, a critical step in the long accession process. While NATO is not yet ready to invite Ukraine to join, allied leaders are set to approve language this week that all but promises Kyiv that it will become part of the alliance.

Europe is ‚Äúsleep walking‚Äù into becoming dependent on Russian fertiliser, just as it did with gas, says one of the largest producers of crop nutrients.

Nitrogen fertilisers, which are important to plant growth, are made using natural gas and Russia is exporting more of it to Europe, replacing some of the gas banned by the EU, said Svein Tore Holsether, chief executive of Yara International, one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of nitrogen-based mineral fertilisers.

‚ÄúFertiliser is the new gas,‚Äù Holsether said. ‚ÄúIt is a paradox that the aim is to reduce Europe‚Äôs dependency on Russia, and then now we are sleepwalking into handing over critical food and fertilising power to Russia.‚Äù

The EU imported twice as much urea, a common fertiliser, from Russia in the year to June 2023 compared with a year earlier, according to Eurostat. Russian imports for the current season, the year to this June, are lower but still historically high and account for a third of total urea imports into the bloc.

The price of crop nutrients soared in the wake of Moscow‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as sanctions imposed on Russia limited availability of natural gas, a main input for nitrogen fertilisers such as ammonia and urea.

This hit European farmers financially while those elsewhere, especially in Africa, stopped using fertiliser altogether, hampering yields and deepening a global food crisis.

Since then fertiliser prices have eased as natural gas prices have come down, but Europe‚Äôs fertiliser industry is still struggling as Russian imports take a bigger share of the market, Holsether said.

Russian fertiliser producers benefit from lower energy costs, said Holsether, adding they also have fewer sustainability constraints and therefore produce more greenhouse gas emissions.

Russia is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers and exporters of nitrogen-containing fertilisers. This is also the case for potash and phosphate, which are mined and cannot replace the nitrogen-based fertilisers.

While Western sanctions carve out exemptions for Russian food and fertiliser exports, Moscow has complained trade has been hindered because of concerns from buyers and their banks and insurers over the involvement of sanctioned Russian individuals or companies.

Despite this, Russian fertiliser export revenue surged 70 per cent in 2022 on the back of higher prices.

Russia could use its increased dominance in the fertiliser market for political leverage ‚Äî just as Moscow has done with energy supplies, said Holsether. ‚ÄúWhen you produce a product that is so important for food production, that‚Äôs a powerful tool,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd again, I think it would be naive to think that at some stage that will not be used for political purposes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat we saw when fertiliser prices really increased is that Europe has an ability to pay that is higher than the global south. So if this is used [as leverage], again it‚Äôs the poorest that will pay the highest price.‚Äù",1bkysju

le3byv2,"US SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, I think it‚Äôs important to note two things.  First ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always important to start here ‚Äì Vladimir Putin has already failed.  He‚Äôs failed in the objective he set, which was to erase Ukraine from the map, to end its existence as an independent state, to subsume it into a greater Russia.  That has failed and it cannot succeed.

Now the measure of success for Ukraine given Russia‚Äôs failure ‚Äì and of course so many other losses that came with that ‚Äì the fact that for Russia now it‚Äôs lost its energy market in Europe, it‚Äôs facing a NATO that is stronger and larger than it‚Äôs ever been, and no one could have imagined three years ago that Finland and Sweden would become members of NATO ‚Äì across the board, virtually everything as a strategic matter that Putin has sought to prevent he has precipitated by his actions.  The question now is what constitutes success for Ukraine going forward.

And I think the answer is straightforward.  It‚Äôs a Ukraine that is strong, that‚Äôs independent, that‚Äôs increasingly integrated with the West, and that stands on its own feet militarily, economically, democratically.  And we have Ukraine on that trajectory.  Even as we‚Äôre working to do everything we can to make sure that it has what it needs to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression, we‚Äôre also helping Ukraine build this plan, program for the future.

Now, a lot has already gone into that, and yes, it will continue to need resources.  But I think if people look at the logic of this, we‚Äôve seen a strong bipartisan majority in both houses of Congress for supporting Ukraine.  I believe that support is still there.  Any administration I think will take account of that.

And any administration has to ask hard questions.  If we stop, if we reverse ourselves, if we let Ukraine down, what will Putin do?  He will then really resume the aggression and possibly have a chance of succeeding where for now he‚Äôs failed.  He won‚Äôt stop at Ukraine.  He‚Äôs likely to go at other countries in the region, including NATO Allies.  And other would-be aggressors far afield from Ukraine ‚Äì far afield from Europe ‚Äì they‚Äôre taking lessons from this too.

kzxyqup,"An influential global body has forecast Russia's economy will grow faster than all of the world's advanced economies, including the US, this year.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Russia to grow 3.2% this year, significantly more than the UK, France and Germany.

Oil exports have ""held steady"" and government spending has ""remained high"" contributing to growth, the IMF said.

Overall, it said the world economy had been ""remarkably resilient""

""Despite many gloomy predictions, the world avoided a recession, the banking system proved largely resilient, and major emerging market economies did not suffer sudden stops,"" the IMF said.

The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They are used by businesses to help plan where to invest, and by central banks, such as the Bank of England to guide its decisions on interest rates.

The group says that the forecasts it makes for growth the following year in most advanced economies, more often than not, have been within about 1.5 percentage points of what actually happens.



Despite the Kremlin being sanctioned over its invasion of Ukraine, the IMF upgraded its January predictions for the Russian economy this year, and said while growth would be lower in 2025, it would be still be higher than previously expected at 1.8%.

Investments from corporate and state owned enterprises and ""robustness in private consumption"" within Russia had promoted growth alongside strong exports of oil, according to Petya Koeva Brooks, deputy director at the IMF.

Russia is one of the world's biggest oil exporters and in February, the BBC revealed millions of barrels of fuel made from Russian oil were still being imported to the UK despite sanctions.



Away from Russia, the IMF downgraded its forecasts across Europe and for the UK this year, predicting 0.5% growth this year, making the UK the second weakest performer across the G7 group of advanced economies, behind Germany.

The G7 also includes France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US.

Growth is set to improve to 1.5% in 2025, putting the UK among the top three best performers in the G7, according to the IMF.

However, the IMF said that interest rates in the UK will remain higher than other advanced nations, close to 4% until 2029.



Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the IMF's figures showed that the UK economy was turning a corner.

""Inflation in 2024 is predicted to be 1.2% lower than before, and over the next six years we are projected to grow faster than large European economies such as Germany or France - both of which have had significantly larger downgrades to short-term growth than the UK,"" he said.

Economists at the IMF warned that if the Israel-Hamas conflict escalates further in the Middle East it could lead to rising food and energy prices around the world.

Continued attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the ongoing war in Ukraine could also affect the so far ""remarkably resilient"" global economy, it said.

A potential spike in food, energy and transport costs would see lower-income countries hardest hit, it added.

Russia has been forced to start storing gas from Vladimir Putin‚Äôs flagship Arctic project, in a sign that western sanctions are deterring buyers.

According to ship-tracking data and satellite images, three vessels have shipped liquefied natural gas from the US-sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 since it started loading operations last month.

One of the ships, Everest Energy, appears to have unloaded at Saam FSU, a floating storage unit anchored in a bay in the Murmansk region of northern Russia. It has since headed back in the direction of Arctic LNG 2.

The transfer ‚Äúunderscores the challenges that Russia faces in finding buyers for its sanctioned LNG‚Äù, said analysts at Kpler, a data and analytics platform.

The other two shipments have also remained in Russian or European waters and have not been delivered to a buyer.

Arctic LNG 2 was intended as a totemic project for the Kremlin: its planned full production had been due to account for a fifth of Russia‚Äôs annual LNG production target of 100mn tonnes by 2030, which would amount to more than three times the volume the country exports now.

Cloud-penetrating radar images taken by European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellites show a large ship matching the Everest Energy‚Äôs size pulling up alongside the Saam FSU, though cloud cover has prevented many clear photographs from being taken of the vessels.

The US last year added Arctic LNG 2, which is led by private energy company Novatek, to its sanctions list in response to Moscow‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Russia sought to counter the sanctions by amassing a ‚Äúdark fleet‚Äù of LNG carriers to export the gas, but the US in late August swiftly imposed sanctions on those vessels and managing companies, which analysts and traders said has probably scared off potential buyers for now.",1bkysju

The State Department reported that the Kremlin created a cyber operations entity within RT in Spring 2023 that provided information to Russian intelligence, media, and mercenary groups.

The EU is preparing to provide up to ‚Ç¨40bn in new loans for Ukraine by the end of the year regardless of US participation, after a G7 plan to use frozen Russian assets to aid Kyiv faltered.

The unilateral push comes amid concern in Brussels that Hungary will prevent the bloc from delivering safeguards that the US needs for it to participate in the frozen asset scheme, according to three people involved in the talks.

The government of Viktor Orb√°n, the EU‚Äôs most pro-Russia leader, has sought to delay a decision on the frozen assets scheme until after the US presidential election on November 5.

But Brussels must start work on any alternative within the next few weeks since such a move would rely on powers that expire at the end of the year.

Turkish exports to Russia tumbled at the start of 2024, suggesting that a US crackdown on trade with goods Moscow uses in its war in Ukraine is starting to pay off.

Exports from Turkey to Russia fell a third in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2023 to $2.1bn, according to Financial Times calculations based on data from the Turkish Statistical Institute.

The decline comes after the Biden administration issued an executive order in late December that gives the Treasury department the power to hit banks with secondary sanctions if they deal with companies that are subject to US bans because of their links to Russia‚Äôs military-industrial complex. The White House deployed the measure in a bid to stymie trade in goods such as microchips that Russian President Vladimir Putin needs for his war against Ukraine.

Turkey is among a clutch of countries that recorded a large increase in trade in these so-called high-priority battlefield goods since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022.

The US along with its partners, such as the EU, have lobbied governments including Ankara to curb this trade.

--------------------------------------------

  
Pravda, a disinformation network and the former official newspaper of Russia‚Äôs Soviet-era Communist Party, is expanding its hold in the EU.

The Russian disinformation network Pravda is expanding its hold in the European Union despite attempts to stop it.

That‚Äôs according to a new report from the European Digital Media Observatory, an independent fact-checking organisation.

France‚Äôs Viginum Agency operated by their national defence and security department (SGDSN) first detected Pravda‚Äôs activities in February as part of a wide-ranging Russian disinformation campaign in the EU.

Pravda is also the former official newspaper of Russia‚Äôs Communist Party during the Soviet Union era.

""A few weeks after the publication of the report, EDMO can confirm that the campaign has expanded significantly in Europe,"" a recent report reads.

**Sites active in 19 EU countries**

The French found a network of websites called ""Portal Kombat"" that opened up ""copycat"" Pravda sites in different languages, like French, German, Spanish, and English, to spread Russian propaganda.

What‚Äôs new in the EDMO report is the creation of more Pravda websites in 19 EU countries, including Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands over a one-week period from March 20 to 26th.

Some countries, like Austria and Belgium, are not covered directly by a new Pravda site but have other outlets that can offer up pro-Kremlin information, the report said.

There are also Pravda sites in non-EU member states such as Norway, Moldova, Bosnia, and as far away as Taiwan and Japan.

All the websites cite Russian state-owned media, like Tass or RIA, and often quote pro-Russian Telegram accounts that publish in local languages. In some cases, they will cite legitimate sources of information if they are found to be pro-Russia.

The websites post hundreds of articles an hour, something the research says shows there is an element of automation in their work.

‚ÄúTheir common modus operandi indicates clearly a coordination behind their publications,‚Äù the report reads.

The articles have common pro-Russian themes, like French troops on the ground in Ukraine or that Western elites ""support a global dictatorship that wants the third world war against Russia,"" it continues.

Despite the flurry of new websites, the EDMO says the impact has been very small and ""almost non-existent"" in some of the target countries. But, that‚Äôs not to say that the websites could be used for a target misinformation campaign closer to the European elections in June.

""Its weakness could be unintentional, but it is possible that this is a 'dummy' operation, to probe reactions and measures taken by local and EU authorities,"" the report reads.",1bkysju

NATO allies agreed in April to initiate planning on long-term military support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion, through setting up a fund worth 100 billion euros ($107 billion).

Under the plans, NATO would take over some coordination work from a U.S.-led coalition known as the Ramstein group.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reiterated the government's earlier opposition to the plan.

""Hungary will stay out of NATO's crazy mission despite all the pressure,"" he told a Facebook-live event in London.

Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs, responding to NATO's initiative last month, said on X that Hungary would back no NATO proposals that ""might draw the alliance closer to war or shift it from a defensive to an offensive coalition"".

Relations between Budapest and NATO have soured because of Hungary's foot-dragging over the ratification of Sweden's NATO accession - finally passed by Budapest in March - and also over nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's warm ties with Moscow despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The U.S. envoy to Hungary said earlier that NATO allies are warning Hungary of the dangers of its ""close and expanding"" relationship with Russia and if this is Budapest's policy choice ""we will have to decide how best to protect our security interests"", David Pressman said.",1bkysju

G7 leaders believe China‚Äôs support for Russia‚Äôs defence-industrial complex poses a ‚Äúlong-term threat‚Äù to European security, as the group seeks to harden its stance on Beijing‚Äôs economic policies that they say are unbalancing global trade.

The US has long pushed for its European partners in the G7 ‚Äî France, Germany, Italy and the EU ‚Äî to hew closer to its more hawkish approach to China, arguing that the country‚Äôs role in propping up President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs regime as it wages war against Ukraine means Beijing has chosen to side with Russia against the west.

The G7 leaders will discuss China on Friday on the second and final day of the group‚Äôs summit in Puglia, southern Italy. The talks come days after the EU announced new tariffs on Chinese electric-car makers that it says are benefiting from unfair subsidies and the US imposed new sanctions on China-based companies supplying Russia with semiconductors that could aid its war machine.

lb0r67f,"Zelensky apparently said that the current ratio of KIA is 6 Russians for each Ukrainian. Assuming Zelensky isn't just throwing out random numbers, I think the important part of that statement is ""current"", e.g. in the past couple of weeks. For the war overall so far,  I wouldn't be surprised if it was something like 3 Russians for each Ukrainian, especially when considering Russian treatment (or lack of it) for wounded. But 6 to 1 sounds improbable.

It should be noted that high estimates for the Winter war have 6 to 1 ratio, and USSR was relatively far more powerful than Finland, compared to Russia vs. Ukraine, and Ukraine has received far more and powerful military aid than Finland did (only Sweden sent significant aid during the Winter War). So it isn't impossible, just not likely given the estimates by western intelligence. But I can definitely believe that it is 6 to 1 when looking at some small time, for example the 2024 Kharkiv offensive has apparently been a miserable failure for Russia.",1bkysju

*‚ÄúPete's unwavering dedication, endless compassion, and relentless commitment to Ukraine and its people have left an everlasting impact on the countless lives he touched,‚Äù the post reads.*

*‚ÄúHis heroism knew no bounds. He was actively involved in saving more than 200 wounded Ukrainian soldiers, evacuating civilians from the most dangerous frontline cities, and bringing humanitarian aid to people in those towns and cities.‚Äù*

*Before the war in Ukraine, Fouch√© worked as a policeman and carpenter in London. In March 2022, he decided to join the fight against the Russians, driven by a desire to protect the vulnerable.*

*""I love you and want to stay with you, but you are safe. The children who are there are not. They need protection,"" he told his 15-year-old daughter at the time.*

*Fouch√© helped set up a field hospital in Brovary and received medical training before joining the defense effort. He also founded the Project Konstantin foundation, which facilitates the rapid evacuation of injured soldiers from the battlefield.*

*In January 2024, he officially joined the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a combat medic, and in February he made an impassioned plea to Western governments to urgently send promised military aid to Ukraine.*

*""For God's sake, what do you people think you are doing when you give out a drop at a time and cancel the transfer of so desperately needed ammunition to Ukraine? What are you trying to achieve?

-----------------------

The introduction:

""In an [article](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/11/30/hybrid-warfare-new-threats-complexity-and-trust-as-the-antidote/index.html) previously published on NATO Review, I explained that the nature of modern warfare is changing at a rapid pace. Consequently, wars are no longer merely about kinetic operations. This means that it is not just physical warfare, but also non-military strategies and tactics that define modern-day conflicts and wars.

""What has also become commonplace is that kinetic operations - which by themselves have become increasingly complex - are combined with non-military strategies aimed at undermining the security of an antagonist. The combination of military and non-military instruments and strategies is done not randomly but in a synchronised way to achieve synergistic effects. In other words, it is this synchronised fusion that optimises the results.

""The bottom line is that a particular country can potentially unleash physical force against an adversary to achieve certain goals. But if the use or threat of conventional or unconventional force is combined with and/or preceded by a degree of subversive tools such as cyber-attacks and disinformation, the overall damage inflicted on the antagonist can be optimised.

""Despite state-driven hybrid warfare entailing a systematic integration of military, political, economic, civilian, and informational tools, it often plays out in grey zones below the threshold of a conventional war. In these grey zones, the military instrument is used unconventionally and innovatively to avoid attribution, responsibility, and sometimes even detection. So a hostile state can employ non-state actors or a non-attributable military force (like the ‚Äú[little green men](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/watch-out-for-little-green-men/)‚Äù) in a clandestine war to deny involvement, but at the same time achieve strategic objectives.""",1bkysju

*Russia dropped at least 38 glider bombs in Belgorod Oblast over the year between April 2023 and April 2024 The Washington Post reported, citing an internal Russian document on July 1.*

*Most of the unexploded ordnance was discovered by civilians, including foresters, farmers, and residents of nearby villages. The Russian Ministry of Defense appears to have been unaware of the bombs' deployment, indicating some devices may have been lying dormant for days.*

*The document reveals that four bombs landed directly on the city of Belgorod, with an additional seven found in surrounding suburban areas. Furthermore, eleven devices were dropped in the border district of Hraivoron, a region described as having a ""difficult operational situation"" that hindered recovery efforts.*

*This sensitive document, intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence and subsequently handed over to The Washington Post, includes a detailed list of incidents, emergency defusal operations, and civilian evacuations, all compiled by Belgorod‚Äôs city emergency department.*

*Russian news outlet Astra corroborated many of the incidents reported in the document, noting they matched information received from local sources and media. However, local authorities typically downplay such events, often attributing explosions to ""accidents"" or Ukrainian artillery, or avoiding comment altogether.*

*Astra also reported that Russia has mistakenly dropped over a hundred bombs on its own territory and occupied areas in eastern Ukraine in the last four months alone. The Russian government has not responded to requests for comment from The Washington Post regarding the document or the mishandled deployment of glider bombs.*",1bkysju

llbejy8,"The U.S. is close to an agreement to give Ukraine long-range cruise missiles that could reach deep into Russia, but Kyiv would need to wait several months as the U.S. works through technical issues ahead of any shipment, U.S. officials said.

The inclusion of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) in a weapons package is expected to be announced this autumn, three sources said, though a final decision has not been made. The sources declined to be named because they are not authorized to discuss the topic.

Sending JASSMs to Ukraine could significantly alter the strategic landscape of the conflict by putting more of Russia in range of powerful, precision-guided munitions, an important concern of the Biden administration, the officials said.
Military analysts have suggested the introduction of JASSMs - which are stealthy and can strike further than most other missiles in Ukraine's current inventory - could push Russian staging areas and supply depots back by hundreds of miles.

This would severely complicate Russia's ability to sustain its offensive operations and potentially provide Ukraine with a strategic advantage.

Launching them from points near Ukraine's northern border with Russia could allow them to hit military installations as far away as the Russian cities of Voronezh and Bryansk. In the south, dropping them near the front lines could enable strikes on airfields or naval facilities in Crimea. https://www.reuters.com/world/us-close-agreeing-long-range-missiles-ukraine-delivery-take-months-2024-09-03/",1bkysju

l1qy018,"Recent Russian gains northwest of Avdiivka have prompted Ukrainian forces to withdraw from other limited tactical positions along the frontline west of Avdiivka, although these withdrawals have yet to facilitate rapid Russian tactical gains. Russian forces remain unlikely to achieve a deeper operationally significant penetration in the area in the near term.

The continued Russian stabilization of their salient northwest of Avdiivka presents the Russian command with a choice of continuing to push west towards its reported operational objective in Pokrovsk or trying to drive northwards to conduct possible complementary offensive operations with the Russian effort around Chasiv Yar.

Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi noted that the threat of a possible future Russian offensive operation against Kharkiv City is causing Ukraine to allocate additional forces and equipment to defending the city, although ISW continues to assess that the Russian military lacks the forces necessary to seize the city.

The Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade denied a recent report that Ukrainian forces had pulled US-provided M1A1 Abrams tanks from the frontline.

lfy967x,"Ukraine has received a first batch of U.S.-built F-16 fighter jets to help it fight Russian forces, Lithuania's foreign minister and a U.S. official have said.
The long-awaited arrival is a milestone for Ukraine, which has not publicly commented on it for now. The lengthy process to procure the U.S.-designed aircraft and train Ukrainian pilots to fly them has frustrated Kyiv.
Russia has had time to prepare defences to try to nullify the F-16s' impact, and Ukraine has had to survive with a depleted air force a fraction of the size and sophistication of its enemy's.
Here are some facts about how the F-16s may help Ukraine and what obstacles still lie in the way of effective deployment.

SMALL NUMBERS

The number of delivered F-16s appears to be small for now. The Times of London cited a source familiar with the matter who put the figure at just six aircraft.
That number is expected to grow, but it is far short of what military analysts say Ukraine needs more than 29 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a non-governmental research group, said at least 60 planes would be needed for significant operations as Ukraine attempts to push Russian aviation back from its borders.

Lawmaker Oleksandra Ustinova, who leads Kyiv's parliamentary commission on arms and munitions, said that Ukraine would need nearer to 120 F-16s to boost its air capability significantly.
While the pilots gain experience in Ukrainian skies and the military builds out its air infrastructure, the initial deliveries could at least help Ukraine strengthen its air shield, some experts say.

""It will provide some air defence and depth capacity, potentially also help intercepting Shaheds [Iranian-built drones] and cruise missiles. Although it is a very expensive way of doing that, munitions-wise,"" said Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for airpower and technology at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
Ukraine's military has worked hard to reduce the threat to the arriving F-16s in recent months by attacking Russian air defences, according to Kuzan.

""The formation of the battlefield, especially in the south, is already taking place,"" he said. ""Ukraine has the capabilities to systematically strike Russia's foremost air defence complexes.""

PILOTS AND MAINTENANCE

Training will be crucial.
""You can have lots of fast jets but if they don't have effective weapons, and air crew able to employ them with effective tactics, then they will just be shot down in large numbers,"" said Bronk.
The timeline for the training of Ukrainian pilots on F-16s has dominated discussions about deliveries and pledges of more than 70 jets.
By the end of 2024, Ukraine expects to have at least 20 pilots ready to fly F-16s, Ustinova said.
""It is difficult to solicit more planes when you don't have people to pilot them,"" she said, adding that, at first, Ukraine will have more F-16s than qualified pilots.
""Waiting in line for 10 years before our pilots are trained is not OK.""
The Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson declined to comment.

U.S. officials have directed questions on training to Ukraine and noted that pilots can also be trained in Europe. However, Bronk said NATO's capacity was already stretched.
He added that aircraft maintenance was an even more pressing challenge than pilot training.
He said most repairs and maintenance would need to happen inside Ukraine, and it would probably have to rely on foreign contractors who know the aircraft.

AIR BASES UNDER THREAT

Russia has intensified its attacks on infrastructure that could be used for the maintenance and deployment of F-16s, some experts said.
""Russia is striking all airfields, potential F-16 bases, every day, including attempts to damage airstrips and infrastructure. These strikes have not paused for the last two months, at least,"" Kuzan said.
The targets will become all the more valuable when the aircraft, pilots and maintenance teams arrive. This is likely to force Ukraine to install missile defences to protect them, even though it is short of both air defence systems and ammunition.

""We have to accept the fact that the airfields will be well-protected when civilian objects could be under attack,"" Kuzan said, adding that each base would need at least two Patriot and two NASAMS batteries to secure it.
""As soon as we (build up our flight capabilities), we will push their planes back and the terror will stop. But these couple of months will be truly difficult,"" Kuzan added. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/f-16s-arrival-not-silver-bullet-ukraine-war-with-russia-2024-06-27/",1bkysju
lfyavi6,"Ukrainian forces deploy more than 100,000 explosive first-person-view drones a month all along the 700-mile front line of Russia‚Äôs 28-month wider war on Ukraine. The drones smash into armored vehicles, chase down exposed infantry and follow artillery fire back to its origin in order to target Russian howitzers.

And today one of the small quadcopter drones‚Äîremotely steered by an operator wearing a virtual-reality headset‚Äîshot down a Russian helicopter, apparently for the first time.

Photos and videos that circulated on social media depict the Mil Mi-8 transport helicopter burning near Donetsk in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. ‚ÄúA speedy recovery to the survivors,‚Äù one Russian blogger wrote.

This new use of explosive drones has been a long time coming. As long ago as September, Ukrainian operators first tried ramming their flying robots into Russian helicopters mid-flight. The drone threat got so serious that the Russian air force began assigning some helicopters to escort other helicopters.

It apparently took at least 10 months of trying before a Ukrainian drone operator finally hit a Russian helicopter. The months of misses are understandable. A helicopter can fly faster than 150 miles per hour at altitudes exceeding thousands of feet‚Äîtoo fast and too high for a two-pound drone to get a clean shot without an enormous degree of skill or luck on the part of the operator.

The Ukrainian drone pilot in the Wednesday shoot-down was very skilled or lucky‚Äîor both. They spotted the 12-ton, three-crew Russian helicopter‚Äîwhich performs attack, transport and medical-evacuation missions‚Äîwhile it was still close to the ground. ‚ÄúCaught at the moment of takeoff,‚Äù a Russian blogger reported.

An FPV drone normally carries just a few pounds of explosives. But it doesn‚Äôt take much firepower to knock down a helicopter if it takes a hit it in the rotors. https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/07/31/a-two-pound-ukrainian-drone-just-shot-down-a-12-ton-russian-helicopter/",1bkysju

Recently Ukraine unveiled long-range missile-drones in addition to weaponized RC cars and RC drone boats. I wouldn't be surprised if they unveiled a submarine drone capable of ignoring the barge blockade of Kerch strait.

There is an immediate need for long-range anti-air missiles. Once Ukraine figures a way to take down Russian warplanes from over 200km away, Russia will lose its capability to launch its devastating glide bombs against Ukraine. I think the current SAM range is 150 km at high altitude, like 50 km at low altitude? Realistically less, as these can't be used on the frontline. Russian fighters and bombers launch glide bombs from well over 50 km away from the target.

So Ukraine needs to figure out how to counter those glide bomb launching planes and it needs long-range anti-air missiles for that. Don't F-16 have such an armament? AMRAAM is 120 km, but the F-16 can't afford to get too close either.

Around the world, the United States under a second Trump presidency would cease to be seen as a leading democracy, or as a leader of anything at all. What kind of country elects a criminal and an insurrectionist as its president ? 

If he wins, Donald Trump has said that he wants mass deportations, perhaps carried out by the military‚Äîand he could do that. He wants to turn the Department of Justice against his enemies, and he might do that too: Just this week, he reposted a demand that Liz Cheney face a military tribunal merely for opposing him. The Supreme Court has just removed some more guardrails around our imperial presidency, and of course that process could continue, especially if Trump is able to pick more justices. If you think the level of polarization and political chaos in the United States is bad now, wait and see what those changes will bring. And if you think none of this can happen in America, please read the history of Hungary or Venezuela, stable democracies that were destroyed by extremist autocrats.

With America focused on its own internal crisis, American alliances in Europe, Asia, and everywhere else could fracture. The network of autocracies led by Russia and China would grow stronger, because their main narrative‚Äîdemocracy is degenerate‚Äîwould be reinforced by the incoherent, autocratic American president.

The US, Israel and Ukraine are in talks to supply Kyiv with up to eight Patriot air defence systems, dramatically improving its ability to counter Russian air strikes.

While not finalised, the arrangement would likely involve the highly prized Patriot systems being sent first from Israel to the US, before being delivered to Ukraine.

The outlines of the deal, which would mark a shift in Israel‚Äôs relations with Moscow, have been discussed between ministers and senior officials of the three countries, according to five people briefed on the negotiations.

Israel said in April that it would begin retiring its eight Patriot batteries, which date back more than 30 years, and replacing them with more advanced systems.

But the batteries, which have been used in Israel‚Äôs current war with Hamas, have not yet been discontinued due to concerns that tensions with the Iran-backed Hizbollah militant group could erupt into a full-blown war.

If realised, such a transfer would represent a step change in Ukraine‚Äôs defensive capabilities. The country currently has at least four Patriot systems, supplied by both the US and Germany.",1bkysju

Those ties have become particularly important to New Delhi as western sanctions designed to isolate Russia have pushed Moscow closer to China.

Ukrainian drones struck a military airfield in Russia‚Äôs Lipetsk region and detonated large amounts of ammunition, while Moscow declared a state of emergency in two regions in the face of Kyiv‚Äôs most ambitious counter-incursion.

The offensive, which raged into a fourth day on Friday, is the largest attack that Kyiv‚Äôs forces have conducted on Russian soil since President Vladimir Putin launched his country‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The drone attack was carried out by Ukraine‚Äôs security service, the SBU, in co-operation with the military and special forces early Friday, a Ukrainian official with knowledge of operations inside Russia told the Financial Times.

The official said the Lipetsk air base ‚Äî about 300km from the international border and just east of the latest fighting ‚Äî was targeted ‚Äúto destroy Russian aviation logistics so that the enemy does not have the opportunity to bomb Ukrainian cities with anti-aircraft missiles‚Äù.

Several warehouses filled with ammunition were detonated in the attack, the official said. Videos published on social media and geolocated by the Financial Times showed massive explosions reaching into the night sky.

The Ukrainian official claimed that up to 700 glide bombs stored in the warehouses were damaged or destroyed. Several dozen fighter jets, including Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft, along with military helicopters that have been used in Russia‚Äôs attacks inside Ukraine, were also located at the air base, said the general staff of Ukraine‚Äôs army.

‚ÄúMost of the planes stationed at the military airfield . . . did not have time to take off,‚Äù the Ukrainian official claimed. 

The FT could not immediately verify whether the bombs and aircraft had been damaged or destroyed. Russian military bloggers reported that no aircraft were damaged.

Lipetsk authorities imposed a state of emergency and ordered the evacuation of residents in nearby towns following the attack. Videos shared on Russian Telegram channels showed lines of civilian vehicles stretching several kilometres fleeing east from the area.",1bkysju

The report starts with an overview of Russia‚Äôs domestic arms production efforts throughout 2023, followed by a detailed examination of key Russian weapons systems (such as tanks, artillery, drones, missiles, and electronic warfare systems) and their changing roles on the battlefield. The report then analyzes Russia‚Äôs general procurement dynamics and identifies the imported components and weapons categories that Russia‚Äôs defense industry has particularly relied on in the second year of the war. This part includes a case study on China to illuminate Russia‚Äôs evolving procurement patterns. The report then dives into analysis of the Kremlin‚Äôs remaining weaknesses, which have been aggravated by a long war of attrition and which can have both short- and long-term effects on its military. The final part of the report assesses how Russia‚Äôs performance throughout 2023 and its evolving defense capabilities might be translated into its offensive posture in Ukraine in 2024. This part of the report is followed by recommendations to Western policymakers on how to counter the Kremlin‚Äôs war effort by capitalizing on the Russian military‚Äôs existing vulnerabilities.""

Looking at his pay cheque, which has tripled since 2022, Russian factory worker Anton does not know whether to laugh or cry.

The 37-year old is painfully aware that the rise is the result of President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs decision to invade Ukraine and turn Russia into a war economy.

‚ÄúOn the one hand, it‚Äôs war, and people ‚Äî even my relatives ‚Äî are dying,‚Äù said Anton, whose uncle was killed in Ukraine.

‚ÄúBut then . . . there is this rebirth of manufacturing,‚Äù he said, with the war having a ‚Äúgenuinely positive effect‚Äù on people‚Äôs quality of life in his region. ‚ÄúHave we ever had a period like this, in the history of our country, when us ‚Äòproles‚Äô have earned this much?‚Äù he added.

As Russia braces for a long war, state orders to arm, fuel, feed and clothe the army are injecting vast sums of money into the economy.

This has led to a boom where many expected western sanctions to deal a painful blow: Russia‚Äôs economy is forecast to grow 3 per cent this year, far above the US and most European states.

The effect is most pronounced in rustbelt regions such as Anton‚Äôs Chuvashia in central Russia, which is home to 1.2mn people and where Soviet factories have been revived and are working around the clock to supply the war. 

‚ÄúSome of the most underperforming regions have suddenly started to grow. Manufacturing regions, areas where there is a lot of defence and related industry,‚Äù said political scientist Ekaterina Kurbangaleeva.

‚ÄúThe most under-developed regions and the low-income segments of the population are the ones that are winning,‚Äù Kurbangaleeva said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the money is going.‚Äù

Understanding the experience of regions like Chuvashia is critical for forecasting Russia‚Äôs long-term ability to sustain its war of attrition against Ukraine, both economically and politically, analysts say.

Pay negotiations had become easier and management more keen to compromise, Anton said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really trying hard to keep us.‚Äù

Inflation, however, has eaten into salary growth. Prices across the country have grown by over 21 per cent since the start of the war, with the cost of food rising even faster.

‚ÄúGo into a shop and take a look, everything has soared,‚Äù another Chuvashia factory worker said. ‚ÄúRbs60,000 a month will go just on food.‚Äù 

Anton said inflation meant his pay rise had not been ‚Äútruly transformative,‚Äù but he felt his purchasing power had grown.

This effect is likely to have an impact on the political views of swaths of the Russian population, bolstering support for the war, sociologists said.",1bkysju

Hnatov stated that Russian offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast aimed to prevent Ukraine from building out reserves and addressing personnel shortages in already committed combat brigades by drawing Ukrainian forces to Kharkiv Oblast from elsewhere along the front, complicating rotations, and forcing Ukraine to commit newly generated forces to defensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast instead of offensive or defensive operations elsewhere in the theater.[2] 

Hnatov stated that Russia continues efforts to prevent Ukraine from accumulating the manpower necessary to conduct counteroffensive operations, consistent with ISW's assessment that ongoing Russian offensive operations throughout eastern and northeastern Ukraine aim to degrade Ukraine's ability to accumulate the manpower and materiel Ukraine requires to contest the battlefield initiative.[3] 

The Russian military command likely views retaining the theater-wide initiative as a strategic imperative and will continue efforts to sustain Russia's current offensive tempo in Ukraine in order to constrain Ukraine's ability to seize the initiative on select sectors of the frontline. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-2-2024",1bkysju

**At Ukraine's request, Lithuania stops funding Ukrainian students' education**

> The Lithuanian government will no longer cover tuition costs for Ukrainian refugees. However, some universities and colleges plan to extend free education for Ukrainian students.

> Since 2022, Lithuania has allowed Ukrainians who fled the war to study at its higher education institutions for free. Students who have already enrolled will be able to graduate without paying tuition fees, but starting this September, this scheme will not be available to new students from Ukraine.

> ‚ÄúWe are organizing all measures to help Ukrainian citizens living in Lithuania in response to the needs of the Ukrainian state, in cooperation and without encouraging the outflow of people from Ukraine,‚Äù the Ministry of Education told BNS.

> The new students will be subject to the same general admission rules as Lithuanian citizens and will be able to apply for state-funded places at public universities and colleges.

Translated with DeepL.com (free version)

My critique is not of Lithuania in no case. They are very free to help or not up to what they feel

Just think about it: our minister of Education* reached out to other countries to ask them to stop helping Ukrainians. And this is not a fluke. Some people spent our government's money to travel abroad and ask governments to stop helping Ukrainian refugees

You can translate it yourself: https://glavcom.ua/country/society/leshchenko-proponuje-jes-zalishiti-bizhentsiv-bez-dopomohi-reaktsija-ukrajintsiv-981849.html

How do you imagine your government's diplomatic effort being traveling around the world for your money to ask other governments not to help you in need?

""Russia's war against Ukraine - the Kremlin's litany of lies""

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocGWkH5QfIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocGWkH5QfIs)

""One year ago, Russia launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine. As their forces continue to relentlessly attack the country, Russian officials keep spreading blatant lies and disinformation about their brutal war against a peaceful country. Russia claimed it had no plans to attack Ukraine, and yet it did. Russia claimed it would not target civilians, while many civilians have been killed and wounded, with hospitals, homes, schools and critical infrastructure destroyed across the country. Despite the Kremlin‚Äôs continued litany of lies, denials and disinformation, their real intentions are clear for the world to see. As Russia launches new offensives, NATO Allies stand in solidarity with Ukraine and will support Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

Russian forces are inching forward in eastern Ukraine after capturing the bastion town of Avdiivka in February. Kyiv's soldiers are trying to dig in, facing long-term shortages of artillery shells with U.S. aid stuck in Congress.

But Republican infighting has created pressure to postpone it again.

* On the 26th of April, a quadcopter drone carrying an IED towards the local FSB building detonated early in Ufa, Bashkortstan. The Private Chuvash Drone Army, which had previousloy carried out an attack on an FSB office in Novorossiysk, took responsibility.

* A partisan group tested an IED near St. Petersburg. https:// t. me/BlackBridgeInt/95
* Another attack was carried out in Karachay-Cherkessia on the 29th of April, this time on a traffic police post. The attackers used a grenade & automatic weapons, killing two police officers and injuring four others. According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, 5 attackers were killed, and IEDs were found at the scene. A week earlier, a similar attack killed three policemen. Presumably the attacks were carried out by the same group. https:// t. me/HeraldOfRebellion/823
* In addition, Ilya Ponomarev (leader of the political wing of the Freedom of Russia Legion, and a member of the Council of People's Deputies, which is positioning itself to be a 'transitional government' to turn Russia into a democracy if Putin's regime falls) stated that Russian anti-Putin partisans are involved in most of Ukraine's drone strikes deep inside of Russia.",1bkysju

Most analysts agree that the extreme left and right in Italy and elsewhere share the same strategic aims: weaken the nation‚Äôs political, economic, and social structure so it becomes an unreliable partner in the transatlantic relationship and NATO. Adding to a menu of measures, the tactics are the same as those currently being used across the EU: through staged protests, the extremist groups create the perception of political instability, and dissatisfaciton with the current policy of aid to Ukraine, and most recently, Israel. Italy is not considered to be a big player when it comes to lethal aid to Ukraine, nor is it a great power on the global stage; however, its geostrategic position in the Mediterranean, and its contribution to NATO in theatres across the world is a necessary element to the West‚Äôs security architecture. Russia has already captured Hungary and Slovakia. It‚Äôs doing its damnest to flip Georgia as well as Italy.¬†¬†¬†


The students occupations and protests began almost immediately after October 8. Alongside La Sapienza, Federico II University of Naples joined the student protest, and Rome Tre soon followed. In the post below, a ‚Äòjournalist‚Äô, Giuliano Granato, working for the pro-Kremlin rag, Il Fatto Quotidiano, was calling for an increase in protests against the ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù at the hands of Israel. He then concluded by saying that only ‚Äúpopular mobilisation can produce change.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†


The word ‚Äòchange‚Äô is sprinkled like parsely in risotto in all of these posts: it cynically manipulates the hopes of our youth into thinking that a simple protest can lead to significant ‚Äòchange‚Äô.

The bill closely mirrors the Senate package, but it adds a requirement for the Biden administration to send more American-made missiles known as long-range ATACMS to Kyiv. The United States has previously supplied Ukraine with a cluster-munition version of the missiles, but only after President Biden overcame his longstanding reluctance to providing the weapons and permitted the Pentagon to deliver them covertly.

It also would direct the president to seek repayment of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who has pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/us/politics/house-israel-ukraine-aid-package-explainer.html

2) We'd like to think that the existential threat Russia poses is more important than the financial threat Iran poses, but business cares more about money than life. Sorry to say, but all of us are expendable, or should I say, disposable.

3) Defending Israel is a lot less risky than defending Ukraine. Israel is not the underdog.

4) Defending Israel is a lot more popular amongst the Jewish community. Jews care more about Israel than a country with a Jewish president.

5) Israel is a lot easier to defend because of the location of allies, the distance of Iran and the open access from the sea. None of these things are in Ukraine's favour.

Ukrainian Navy Spokesperson Captain Third Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk stated on August 3 that Ukrainian forces successfully destroyed a Russian S-400 and S-500 air defense system that the Russian military had deployed to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge.[2] ISW has not yet observed visual evidence of Ukrainian forces striking Russian air defense systems in occupied Crimea on August 2. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the Ukrainian strike sank the Rostov-on-Don at the Sevastopol port.[3] 

Ukrainian forces previously struck and significantly damaged the submarine at the Sevastopol port in September 2023, after which it underwent repairs at the port.[4] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian MGM-140 ATACMS strike against occupied Sevastopol on August 2.[5] Satellite imagery captured on August 2 shows some damage to a structure purportedly protecting the Rostov-on-Don in the Sevastopol port, but ISW cannot yet independently verify reports that the Ukrainian strike destroyed the submarine. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-3-2024",1bkysju

Dmitry Rogozin, a hardline Russian senator, warned on Sunday against blaming Kyiv and its western allies for the attack. ‚ÄúIf we ascribe every terrorist attack steeped in ethnic and religious intolerance, hatred and Russophobia to Ukraine and Nato‚Äôs scheming, then this red mist will cause us major problems,‚Äù Rogozin wrote on social media. ‚ÄúWe can see the speck in our brother‚Äôs eye, but not the log in ours.‚Äù",1bkysju

Ukraine's problem is that there is no such thing as a win-win between the Democrats and Republicans.

1- If the Republicans pass another Ukraine aid package Biden will try to take credit for it and use it as part of his campaign for re-election. The Republicans are not going to do anything that helps Biden.

2- The Republicans have offered to sign on to an aid package if Biden and the Democrats will sign on to their extremely restrictive immigration bill, H.R.2. If Biden does that the far Left portion of his voting base will flip out and Biden will lose more support than he can gain by trumpeting his ""leadership"" on Ukraine. So the Democrats are not going to sign on to the severe immigration restrictions that the Republicans want.

3- Trump asked Zelensky to dig up dirt he could use against the Bidens in his re-election campaign in 2020. Zelensky very reasonably said no, but that made Trump his enemy which is a bit of problem since Trump runs the Republican Party.

l6xomv3,"This is the important question over China and Russia: Does China genuinely support Russia due to some ideological or more complex geopolitical reasons - or are they just ruthlessly seeking their own material benefit in whatever way they can?

If the support is ideological, then China will probably give Russia a lot of support for cheap, will help Russia and buy their fossil fuels at inflated prices, will supply weapons and equipment for cheap, and otherwise go out of its way to help Russia even if China doesn't directly benefit. They also won't care about the threat of sanctions, for example.

If it is purely about self-interested material benefit, then China will squeeze Russia dry. They will get cheap fossil fuels from Russia if they can get them, and won't care if the Russian economy collapses, as long as China benefits. They might sell equipment and weapons  to Russia, but only if they can make money by doing that, and they will be worried about Western sanctions hurting their economy.

I think so far China has rhetorically leaned towards ideological support, with attempts to put the blame over Ukraine on the West, but their actions have been much more in line with simple self-interest. If that continues, Russia will continue to find itself becoming a vassal state of China, and China will not hesitate to sell them out whenever it suits China. The war in Ukraine doesn't matter to China, but it does matter to China that it has brought additional attention to the defense of Taiwan, has increased Western military spending and production, and made everyone take the threat to Taiwan far more seriously.",1bkysju

Russia has considered itself at war with the West for decades. Unless something fundamentally changes in Russia , which is very unlikely, we'll be at war with Russia for decades to come. Even if Putin dies tomorrow, Russia will remain a fascist KGB state and one of China's vassal states, like North Korea. There is no peace on the Korean peninsula, 70 years after the war btw.

Even a cease-fire will be difficult to achieve, since Ukraine rightly considers this as an opportunity for Russia to rearm itself.

And even if Russia is defeated and kicked out of Ukraine, it has annexed big chunks of Ukrainian land it doesn't even control, one more roadblock to a peace treaty...

Eventually we will see a tipping point, where russia has ran out of its soviet stocks and cannot maintain production to meet the demands of the war.¬†

However we are not there yet and will not be at least till the end of the year. So if Ukraine can hold till then, and continue doing what it‚Äôs currently doing, it should slowly start to gain ground.

As sad and scary as it all looks, at least the trend lines are positive for Ukraine. Not much of a consolation but it is something.",1bkysju
l71507z,"The war can end early and even very soon if something dramatically changes in Russia, for example Putin dies, and his potential successors are too busy fighting each other to continue the war in Ukraine, and/or his successor decides to end the war, blaming it on Putin. 

But if nothing suddenly changes in Russia, then it will be a long slog, a resource war where the ""winner"" is the one with better production and the logistics to effectively use that production. This is a war that Ukraine should win, as long as the West isn't taken over by the Trumps and Orbans of the world, as Russia just isn't going to be able to compete with the whole of NATO in military production. However, the Russian population has shown willingness (or rather apathy) to absorb heavy hits to their living standards, so Russia will be able to keep going for a long time even if Ukraine reaches a point where they have superiority in resources. Maybe at that point Putin would finally realize that it is over and withdraw from Ukraine, but given his mental state so far, that doesn't seem likely.

I would say that there is a high chance the war will go on for at least 2 more years, but with a smaller chance that it ends suddenly at any time before that, even as soon as in 6 months. I think the Iran-Iraq war is somewhat comparable, very brutal and bitter, and it lasted nearly 8 years,  so I think more than 6 more years is unlikely. 2 more years is about when I expect Russia to just be so low on everything (money reserves, economic trickery, Soviet stockpiles etc.) that it isn't possible to deny reality any more.

However, this war has on a smaller scale been going on since 2014, and there have been longer wars, so nothing is guaranteed. We simply don't know where the breaking point is for Russia and Putin, or if Ukraine might also reach some sort of breaking point. The world is a complex place and a lot can hinge on small matters.

First, in the direct military sense, by opening a new front they force Russian forces to divert to counter the new threat, drawing them away from where they are massed elsewhere. This is likely a more efficient method of removing Russian forces from Ukraine than by driving into massive minefields.

Secondly they open a whole section of the front along the border which had previously been considered ""dormant"" by the Russians, forcing them to think about defending it. This would again divert forces away from positions in Ukraine.

The other objectives are political. Ukraine knows that the central pillar of Putin's existence as absolute ruler of Russia is his perceived strength and ability to keep the evils of the west at bay. So far nothing has seriously punctured that perception, and while Russia is propagandised, its people will hear about a hostile incursion and occupied territory. Adding to this is the units of conscript soldiers that will face direct battle, be injured, killed or captured.

Despite some initial success in the Kursk operation, where Ukraine demonstrated its ability to challenge Russia‚Äôs numerical advantage and captured nearly 600 prisoners of war, the broader strategic impact has been limited. Russia remains undistracted from its key objective of advancing towards the vital Ukrainian logistical hub of Pokrovsk. Russian forces have made significant gains, exploiting weaknesses in Ukraine‚Äôs fortifications and demonstrating resilience and tactical effectiveness. Ukrainian defenses in the Donbas are faltering, with concerns about insufficient planning and resources. As the situation around Pokrovsk worsens, Ukraine may be forced to commit more of its reserves, potentially losing the element of surprise in future operations.",1bkysju

lc6duqv,"The priority goal of Ukraine is to win the war. The president has generals to oversee the war, he is a politician and diplomat, not a military strategist. The priority thing the Ukrainian president can do to help with the war effort is to get more weapons for Ukraine. The number one way to do that is to go abroad and visit different leaders in person and ask them for help and military agreements and other such things. 

Of course, the president still has domestic issues to do, but he also has a whole parliament and a prime minister to run the country with him. Diplomacy regarding billion-euro trade deals and military commitments usually happens head of state to head of state, and Zelensky has gained a lot of fame and respect internationally, so he will be more effective at doing that than any other Ukrainian diplomat.

What do you want Zelensky to do, spend all of his time sitting in the Mariinskyi palace and yell every day at the Ukrainian people to fight harder? No, he should spend his time wisely on whatever helps the most. Sometimes that means staying at home to attend to things he cannot attend to remotely, sometimes that means going for a visit to the frontline to boost morale, sometimes it means going to Poland to sign a piece of paper.

That paper might do nothing, it might provide Ukraine with another billion euros worth of Polish military aid, it might lay the groundwork for Ukrainian membership in NATO after the war. Or maybe the paper is just an excuse for him to show up in Poland and remind the Polish people and politicians of the struggle in Ukraine, and for example appeal to them to not cause further problems like the recent farmer blockades at the border.

Zelensky has spent plenty of time in Ukraine. During the first days of the war, he didn't flee, he stayed in Kyiv even when it looked like the city might fall under a quick Russian offensive. He has repeatedly visited Ukrainian troops just a kilometre or two from the frontlines. The times you hear about him the most is when he does something unusual, like going to Poland for a visit. You don't hear about all the times that he stayed in Ukraine and for example worked on domestic issues.

You're a one-day old account that is coming here to spread unjustified hatred against Zelensky and international diplomacy (""pointless papers"") in an a rather obnoxious manner.

Russia is not going to accept a peace treaty if they think they can continue the war to get more than they ask in the peace treaty.

It's not certain. It is entirely possible, that Russia will capture the entire Ukraine, including Kyiv.

>But we shouldn't overestimate Russia's position either. They're not advancing very fast.

They're not advancing very fast right now, but there is no guarantee that it will remain that way. Speed of advancement changes during the war. You could see it at the beginning of 2022, when Russia quickly captured large area, then their advance stalled, they then quickly lost large swaths of land, then the lines froze for some time, then then again lost large area, then lines froze again.

Currently lines are almost frozen, but if Russia does enough damage for Ukrainian lines to crumble, they may capture large amounts of land pretty quickly again.

kyo3t7g,">While I largely agree, it depends on what you consider ""losing the war"".

Any scenario where Russia gets to keep lands it annexed since Feb 2022 with Ukraine getting nothing in return means losing the war. It means Russia managed to land-grab even more from Ukraine. Yes, the cost may be high, but they succeeded. It will mean they will want to do it again and again.

>But I do think it's important to remember that from the beginning NATOs two goals were 1) Prevent the war from spreading and 2) Ensure that Ukraine continue to exist as a sovereign state. The west never had full liberation as a goal. That's something we hawkish people want.

These are either a result of wishful thinking or at best trying to make a good face in a bad situation. If Ukraine loses, the chance of war spreading spikes. The chance of Russia remaining irredentist, militarist, aggressive and oriented for more land-grab spikes. The feelings of injustice, hate, fear in the region spikes. Nothing will calm down. I have never understood those claiming otherwise. They are simply day-dreaming that war ending means all of a sudden returning to former *status quo*, without taking into account the hugely changed atmosphere. Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state is directly dependent on this war. They will not survive as a rump state. It will mean even bigger Russia and an even smaller Ukraine. What are the odds that Ukraine would come out of this? Let me remind you that Putin has openly spread ideology that Belarus and Ukraine are part of Russia.

>Kyiv will not fall. And that can be seen as a victory for Ukraine and defeat for Russia.

If Ukraine loses the war, how exactly are we going to guarantee it? Are we going to permanently militarize a rump state Ukraine, e.g. largely continue what we are doing now in the hope that *this time* it deters Russia? Who will invest a Ukraine smaller than before after a lost war? Will Ukrainians move back to such a country? I don't think you've thought this trough.

What is more, Russia absorbing large parts of Ukraine means also accessing their resources. Russia is already the world's largest grain exporter. This would make them the absolute key player. Russia would also gain control of even more mineral resources. Good luck maintaining any relevancy for Europe after that which is already now weakened by its crippling dependency on resources.",1bkysju

The real issue would be the industrial shift that occurs to support fighting such a war. Russia is ahead in this area and is ahead in its ability to logistically supply, maintain, equip, and reconstitute forces at scale. 

Europe is more than capable of doing this, but the issue is that it takes 12-18 months for supply chains and industries to shift into doing so.  In the event of a hypothetical large scale flare up between Russia and Europe, I would actually expect Russia to maintain somewhat parity with European forces until the latter's industrial capacity catches up. 

I also predict that it won't be Russian blood wearing down NATO forces in this hypothetical scenario. I expect Russia to force press huge numbers of Belorussian and  Ukrainians to throw at the front lines. Why? Cause that's what Russia has always done.

So yes, there are actual game changing tactics out there: to use NATO equipment and the soldiers trained by NATO for it in a way the equipment was developed to work instead of trying to adapt modern weapons to 1960s trench warfare while complaining that the stupid West is not training soldiers properly for that bullshit.

Even misusing tanks (even when they are much more precise than their Russian counterparts) as cheap wannabe-artillery, adding consumer level drones with cheap dropped explosives and using (often western provided) intelligence and precision weapons to attack important military targets instead of just random grids only gets you so far when your are -at the basic tactic level- still trying to beat Russia at operating like Russia.",1bkysju

In 1974, Grassley was a freaking member of the Iowa House of Representatives. He most likely didn't even know Nixon personally, let alone have a deep personal relationship with him. Perhaps he shook Nixon's hand at some campaign event in Iowa.

Grassley only got to DC in 1975. He didn't have any ""deep personal relationship"" with Ford either - he was just another backbencher from rural Iowa.

Seriously how can you even write such an absurdity without feeling embarrassed? 

And claiming Grassley had a ""deep personal relationship"" with Trump would be patently false - I doubt Grassley would claim such a thing - in fact, I'm sure he wouldn't. But we know Grassley never had a ""deep personal relationship"", or any personal relationship, with Nixon. In fact, I'm not sure Grassley ever had a ""deep personal relationship"" with any POTUS ever.

Individually, of course, the situation is terrible. From the point of view of an ordinary person, life under the occupation of the Russian state is also a terrible situation: you live in a black hole that will never have prospects, you live in a situation where the Russian military can send you to a concentration camp ""[Izolyatsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izolyatsia_prison)"" or as they call it ""to the basement"" 

> Ukrainian state is sacrificing people against their will for ideals they do not necessary share. It is the worst state can do to an individual. There is no excuse to this.

Yes. No one is saying that this is a good practice. That is the nature of war. I have no doubt that many men did not want to die liberating the world from the Nazis in the Second World War, because people do not want to die. No one is born for war. But sometimes it is vital to fight.

The Ukrainian state is at war not to disappear from the political map of the world. It is fighting to avoid the disappearance of its culture and the appearance of [mass graves](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/16/some-hanged-themselves-the-work-to-find-answers-amid-iziums-mass-grave) of people with their hands bandaged. 

The situation for men is difficult and sad, regardless of what they do: go to defend the state, hide or go abroad. The situation for the state is also difficult: it will either disappear or not. There is no ""right solution"" that will satisfy everyone. This is the reality.

ls668my,"I'll say what many might think but hesitate to voice: Ukraine is currently losing the war, and the trend is negative unless drastic measures are taken.

Debates over what constitutes loss or victory can be had, and yes, Ukraine‚Äôs survival so far is a big win. But even if Russia halts advances and goes on the defensive, we lack the resources to reclaim territories to the 2022 borders, let alone the 1991 borders. This is due to many factors: delayed mobilization, insufficient aid, weak sanctions enforcement, a lack of political will in the West, poor military decisions, delayed aid due to de-escalation concerns, and the sheer reality of fighting a country with four times our population, with superior numbers in almost all domains and one of the largest military industries, supported by regimes like North Korea, which contribute more than some European countries with far larger GDPs.

Manpower shortages are another issue, but that's a separate discussion. Ukrainian leadership bears a good part of the responsibility for these problems. Still, if the West can‚Äôt supply the 14 brigades Zelensky requested, why discuss drafting hundreds of thousands more? We need to completely re-arm way more existing brigades. Who‚Äôs going to pay for them? Let‚Äôs be honest - there‚Äôs little enthusiasm in the U.S. or Europe to fund this.

If Russia retains its occupied territories, it will undermine one of Europe‚Äôs core security principles: that borders cannot be redrawn by invading force. In 2014, Russia violated this order, leading to the 2022 invasion. This time, it‚Äôs not just Ukraine that will have failed - it‚Äôs Ukraine, the U.S., and Western Europe‚Äôs failure to defeat Russia.

Some might cite Finland's Winter War, as an example of what Ukraine should have done, but that war lasted three months and ended with Finland ceding territory, paying reparations in the form of machinery, and renting a port to the Soviets. Ukraine's demographics today are also very different: the 18-25 age group is among the smallest, a reality across modern Europe.

Unless Ukraine and the West create a serious plan to radically increase aid to support mobilization - where Ukraine commits to mobilizing more people on the condition that they are properly armed and trained, and the West provides robust air defense to intercept missiles as decisively as the U.S. does for Israel - Ukraine will lose the war of attrition. This will force unfavorable peace, and mass migration from Ukraine to other countries, setting a dangerous precedent, and making it look like the West lost to Russia in the eyes of the world, especially among the enemies of the West https://x.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1846332987283030181",1fkglfj

loi8kgo,"Ukraine's September 18 strike against a Russian missile and ammunition storage facility near Toropets, Tver Oblast reportedly destroyed enough Russian munitions to affect Russian operations in the coming months.[1] Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center Head Colonel Ants Kiviselg stated on September 20 that the strike caused 30,000 tons of munitions to explode, noting that the size of the explosion equates to 750,000 artillery shells and that Russian forces on average fire 10,000 shells per week. 

His calculations suggest the Ukrainian strike destroyed two to three months of Russia‚Äôs ammunition supply. Ukrainian outlet Suspilne reported on September 18 that a source within Ukrainian special services stated that the Toropets facility stored Iskander missiles, Tochka-U ballistic missiles, glide bombs, and artillery ammunition.[2] It is unclear if Kiviselg's statement about 30,000 tons of explosives includes both missiles and artillery ammunition, but the strike destroyed significant Russian materiel stockpiles in any case. ISW continues to assess that continued Ukrainian strikes against rear Russian logistics facilities within Russia will generate wider operational pressures on the Russian military, including forcing the Russian military command to reorganize and disperse support and logistics systems within Russia to mitigate the impact of such strikes.[3]

Note: If Kiviselg meant 10,000 shells per week, then Russian forces would use roughly over 100,000 shells in two and a half months whereas if Kiviselg meant 10,000 shells per day then Russian forces would use 750,000 shells in two and a half months. Kiviselg appears to have misspoken and meant to say that Russian forces use 10,000 shells per day, although ISW cannot confirm if this is the case. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-22-2024",1fkglfj

The potential impact of Donald Trump on the Ukraine war and the western alliance is well understood. But what happens in Germany could be almost as important.

The Germans are the second-largest national aid donors to Ukraine, after the US, and they are central players in both the EU and Nato. But populist parties, sympathetic to Russia, are on the rise in Germany.

The Alternative for Germany party (AfD) almost won the elections in the state of Brandenburg on Sunday. This is the party‚Äôs third strong performance in a row, after coming first in state elections in Thuringia and a close second in Saxony.

Combine the AfD vote with that of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and something like a third of Germans ‚Äî and many more in eastern Germany ‚Äî are voting for populist parties that are militantly anti-migration, hostile to Nato and determined to cut off aid to Ukraine. When Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Bundestag in June, all but four of the AfD‚Äôs 77 members boycotted his speech.

The policy stances taken by the AfD and BSW, combined with accusations that many AfD members have an undeclared agenda that is even more extremist, mean that Germany‚Äôs traditional parties will refuse to go into coalition with the populists ‚Äî at least at the national level. But the rise of the political extremes is already having an influence on government policies. Germany‚Äôs decision to impose border controls with its EU neighbours reflects the angst about illegal migration that the populists have capitalised on.

Ukraine‚Äôs supporters worry that the next policy adjustments will involve a softening of German support for Kyiv. The Ukrainian army is already struggling to hold off Russian forces in the east of the country and is running short of ammunition and troops. A decline in German and American support for Ukraine could help Russia to win the war.

Even if Russian tanks do not roll into Kyiv, Ukraine‚Äôs supporters worry that the Zelenskyy government may soon be forced to make territorial concessions that would allow Vladimir Putin to claim victory. A bad peace deal could put Ukraine‚Äôs future as a viable nation in doubt and embolden Putin to threaten other countries.

Ukraine‚Äôs friends in Berlin see proliferating signs of a possible softening in German support. While Britain and the US are debating allowing Ukraine to use their long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, Germany has ruled out supplying its own Taurus missiles.

Germany‚Äôs finance minister, Christian Lindner, has said that there can be no further package of financial aid for Ukraine, without making politically impossible compensatory cuts in the budget. The EU‚Äôs decision to mobilise some frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine has taken the financial pressure off Berlin for now. But the question of German financial aid is certain to return.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz is lagging badly behind in national polls and looks to be heading for defeat in next September‚Äôs federal elections. Ukraine‚Äôs most ardent supporters worry that Scholz may be tempted to try to revive his political fortunes, by launching a pre-election peace initiative with Russia.

Nervousness about what Scholz might be up to was reflected in rumours doing the rounds in Berlin last week that a contact group, composed of members of his Social Democratic party, was in Moscow for secret talks.

These suggestions were waved away in the chancellery. Scholz‚Äôs key aides seem almost equally exasperated by the Russophile populists and by the hawks in Berlin that are demanding a sharp increase in aid for Kyiv. They see themselves as representing the moderate German middle on Ukraine. The government‚Äôs task, as Scholz sees it, is to keep a divided country together around a basically pro-Ukraine policy.

For the Ukrainians, however ‚Äî long frustrated by what they regard as the snail-like pace of German aid ‚Äî any suggestion that the Scholz government may become even more cautious is dismaying. Hawks in Kyiv and Berlin argue that if Putin is not defeated in Ukraine, he will move on to threaten Nato and ultimately Germany itself.

Scholz and his allies insist that he is not naive about the threat posed by Putin. They see the daily evidence of Russian brutality in Ukraine, as well as sabotage and disinformation inside Germany itself. Over the long term, German analysts worry that Russia has now fully converted into an economy primed for war and weapons production. They note that some of the most advanced weaponry that Russia is churning out is not being used in Ukraine, but seems to be being stored for some possible future conflict.

The German chancellor knows all this. But political leaders live in the moment and their outlooks are almost invariably dominated by domestic politics. Scholz has a very difficult election ahead and would like to run as the peace candidate.

He is also based in Berlin ‚Äî a city that has seen so much darkness and tragedy ‚Äî but which now feels a long way from the front lines of Ukraine. Last week, the pavement bars and bike paths near the chancellor‚Äôs office were full of people enjoying the late summer sunshine. The idea that dark times are returning to Europe is a hard thing for a government ‚Äî or for a people ‚Äî to face.",1fkglfj

The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces intercepted 101 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 drones over Krasnodar Krai and three drones over Tver Oblast.[5] Krasnodar Krai regional authorities blamed the Tikhoretsk Arsenal explosion on falling Ukrainian drone debris, declared a local state of emergency, altered railway schedules and routes, and evacuated about 1,200 civilians from the area.[6] The United Kingdom (UK) MoD reported that the Russian Main Artillery Directorate's 103rd Arsenal near Toropets, which Ukrainian forces struck on September 17 to 18, had recently undergone modernization because Russian forces had been improperly storing munitions at their arsenals, causing explosions at several depots.[7]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces also struck a Russian Podlet K1 mobile long-range radar system that was protecting the Tikhoretsk Arsenal, and this system is at least the fifth Podlet K1 system that Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged or destroyed since February 2022.[8] The Podlet K1 system can detect up to 200 aerial targets simultaneously at a range of up to 300 kilometers and the Russian military introduced the system into service in 2015.[9] Russian forces use the Podlet K1 system to detect air targets at low and very low altitudes for Russian air defenses, including S-300 and S-400 systems.[10] 

Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged or destroyed at least four other Russian Podlet K1 systems since the onset of the full-scale invasion, including in Lazurne, Kherson Oblast as of July 20, 2022; near Zelenotropynske, Kherson Oblast as of July 24, 2022; in Belgorod Oblast as of November 1, 2023; and in an unspecified location as of April 27, 2024.[11] Ukrainian forces also found a destroyed Russian Podlet K1 system in Chornobaivka, Kherson Oblast on November 14, 2022, following Ukraine's liberation of west (right) bank Kherson Oblast as of November 11, 2022, though the cause of this Podlet K1's destruction was unclear. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-21-2024",1fkglfj

The German Bundestag also announced on September 25 a 400 million euro ($447 million) increase in military funding for Ukraine to enable the purchase of additional air defense systems, tanks, drones, ammunition, and spare parts.[2] French President Emmanuel Macron said during a meeting with Zelensky on September 25 that France will train and fully equip a Ukrainian brigade in the ""near future.""[3]

The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced on September 25 that the Pentagon will send an additional military assistance package to Ukraine worth roughly $375 million and that the package will include: air-to-ground munitions; HIMARS ammunition; 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; M1117 armored security vehicles; Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles; light tactical vehicles; armored bridging systems; small arms, patrol boats; demolitions equipment and munitions; and other miscellaneous equipment and support materiel.[4] 

US President Joe Biden announced on September 26 that he directed the DoD to allocate all of the remaining security assistance funding to Ukraine (roughly $8 billion) by the end of Biden's presidential term, including funding from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and that he authorized $5.5 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority to fund the drawdown of US equipment for Ukraine and replenish US stockpiles.[5] Biden stated that the DoD will also announce an additional assistance package worth $2.4 billion to provide Ukraine with additional air defense systems, unmanned aerial systems, and air-to-ground munitions; strengthen Ukraine's defense industry; and support Ukraine's maintenance and sustainment requirements. 

Biden also announced that the US will provide Ukraine with Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) long-range munitions, a refurbished Patriot air defense battery, and additional Patriot missiles and will expand F-16 training capabilities to accommodate training 18 additional Ukrainian pilots in 2025.

Zelensky also stated that Ukraine can produce 15 ""Bohdan"" self-propelled artillery systems every month and recently conducted a successful flight test for an unspecified domestically produced ballistic missile.[3] Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov stated on October 2 that Ukraine will continue prioritizing domestic production of drones and long-range missiles, including ballistic missiles.[4] Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stated on October 2 that Ukraine has allocated $7 billion for the purchase of weapons and military equipment in the Ukrainian draft 2025 state budget ‚Äî a 65 percent increase from the 2024 state budget.[5]

Russia has expanded the capacity of its shadow fleet of oil tankers by almost 70 per cent year-on-year despite a recent crackdown on insurers and shipping companies enabling Moscow to circumvent western sanctions, new research has shown.

The volume of Russian oil transported by poorly maintained and underinsured tankers has increased from 2.4mn barrels per day in June 2023 to 4.1mn in June 2024, according to a report published by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) on Monday.

The trend comes as the US, Canada, Japan and European allies increasingly targeted global insurers and ship owners in a bid to crack down on Moscow‚Äôs ability to generate revenues for its war in Ukraine. They also added to the sanctions list companies and individual vessels associated with the Russian shadow fleet. 

‚ÄúSanctions on tankers have been quite effective but the designation campaign has been too limited to actually rein in Russia‚Äôs shadow fleet,‚Äù said Benjamin Hilgenstock, one of the authors of the KSE report.

He added that sanctions should be used ‚Äúsystematically‚Äù to enforce a requirement for adequate oil spill insurance and, thereby, ‚Äúaddress the serious and urgent environmental threat stemming from the shadow fleet‚Äù.

Many of these vessels regularly navigate busy European waters, including the Baltic Sea, the Danish Straits and the Strait of Gibraltar, increasing the risk of environmental disasters for the EU and neighbouring countries.

KSE proposes the establishment of ‚Äúshadow-free‚Äù zones in European waters to mitigate those risks. Otherwise a disaster is just ‚Äúwaiting to happen on Europe‚Äôs doorstep,‚Äù the report argues. ‚ÄúThe weak link in the regulatory framework, together with the dramatically expanded role of shadow tankers in the Russian oil trade, means that a major environmental disaster is only a question of time.‚Äù",1fkglfj

Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine has turned into the first full-scale drone war. Ukraine is dominating this aspect of the conflict through its innovation and leadership in drone production.

Moscow is lagging behind in the drone war, relying on outdated Iranian drones and facing technological limitations due to global sanctions, despite efforts such as increased drone production and training programs. 

While Ukraine leads in drone production and continues to attack Russia‚Äôs own infrastructure, Russia still has more resources than Ukraine.

Russia has steadily tightened exit requirements for foreign companies since Western sanctions were imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, demanding sharp discounts on any deal before giving approval, and taking a portion of the sale price to bolster state coffers, dubbed an ""exit tax"" by Washington.

Budget contributions from foreign company exit deals reached almost 140 billion roubles ($1.51 billion) by the end of August, budget data showed, already surpassing last year's total of 116.5 billion roubles.

Reuters reported last year that some foreign companies trying to exit Russia were facing a big jump in costs as Moscow demanded bigger discounts, well above the 50% minimum threshold initially demanded.

A source within Ukrainian special services told Ukrainian outlet Suspilne on September 18 that drone operators from Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR), and Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) struck a facility at the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) Main Missile and Artillery Directorate's 107th Arsenal in Toropets, Tver Oblast.[1] 

The explosion was truly cataclysmic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukhqqRdhcMw

Suspilne's sources stated the facility stores Iskander missiles, Tochka-U ballistic missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and artillery ammunition and that there were significant secondary detonations following the initial Ukrainian drone strike. Head of Ukraine's Center for Combatting Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, stated that Russian forces may have also stored ammunition for Grad multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), S-300 and S-400 air defense missiles, and North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles at the facility.[2] 

Footage published on September 16 shows large secondary detonations, presumably of missile stockpiles and artillery ammunition, following the initial drone strike.[3] Geolocated footage published on September 18 shows several large smoke plumes over the facility and satellite imagery shows significant damage to the building in the southern part of the facility, although most of the facility is obscured by smoke.[4] Russian authorities claimed that wreckage from a downed Ukrainian drone struck the facility and prompted the secondary detonations, and Russian authorities temporarily evacuated the area near the facility.[5] 

Russian milbloggers largely criticized Russian authorities for poorly constructing the facility and accused Russian forces of possibly mishandling missiles and artillery ammunition stockpiles at the facility.[6]  Milbloggers accused the detained former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Army General Dmitri Bulgakov of engaging in corrupt practices leading to poor construction quality at the facility. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-18-2024",1fkglfj

Even before Kim Jong Un sent troops to support Russia‚Äôs fight against Ukraine, there were signs that North Korea‚Äôs main backer, China, was unhappy with his regime‚Äôs deepening ties with Moscow.

In a letter last week seen as signalling Beijing‚Äôs growing displeasure, Chinese President Xi Jinping thanked Kim for a congratulatory message on the 75th anniversary of Communist China‚Äôs founding ‚Äî but omitted a traditional reference to North Korea as a ‚Äúfriendly neighbouring country‚Äù.

Kim appears unabashed. Western allies this week revealed that North Korea had sent more than 12,000 troops, disguised as ethnic minorities from Siberia, to fight on Russia‚Äôs front lines, a move that analysts say will only heighten Beijing‚Äôs concerns over its neighbours‚Äô increasingly cosy military ties.

‚ÄúThe North Korean troop deployment is a dramatic step, and China will not like it one bit,‚Äù said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul.

For China, the deployment ‚Äî a sharp escalation in a partnership that has deepened since Moscow‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but was previously largely limited to munitions ‚Äî threatens to destabilise the delicate balance of power on the Korean peninsula.

Closer Russian-North Korean ties could also spur the US, Japan and South Korea to strengthen their military alliance in east Asia, which Beijing already views as aimed at containing its growing power.

Beijing wants to avoid at all costs a rerun of the early years of the cold war, when the Soviet Union, North Korea and China formed a ‚Äúnorthern triangle‚Äù that faced off against a ‚Äúsouthern triangle‚Äù of South Korea, Japan and the US, Chinese scholars said.

‚ÄúChina‚Äôs situation now is really difficult, genuinely a dilemma,‚Äù said Zhu Feng, executive dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, we don‚Äôt want to see the return of the cold war to east Asia. On the other hand, the US is trying to strengthen solidarity with South Korea and Japan.‚Äù

Japan‚Äôs chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday said that escalating Russian-North Korean co-operation was ‚Äúdeeply concerning‚Äù and would ‚Äúworsen the situation in Ukraine and impact the security of the region around Japan‚Äù.

Some analysts said Beijing might be tolerating North Korean arms shipments to Russia to alleviate pressure to provide direct military assistance itself.

Jaewoo Choo, head of the China centre at the Korea Research Institute for National Security think-tank in Seoul, said ‚ÄúBeijing may actually be secretly pleased that Russia is providing economic aid to North Korea in China‚Äôs place‚Äù, at a time when China‚Äôs own domestic growth was lagging.

‚ÄúChina remains in the driving seat because ultimately it has control over both countries,‚Äù said Lankov, referring to Pyongyang‚Äôs reliance on aid from Beijing. ‚ÄúIf China wanted to put a stop to this nonsense as they see it, then they could do so.‚Äù",1fkglfj

lu51s3n,"Russia's economy and war effort is coming under increasing strain, which will pose increasingly acute challenges to Putin's ability to sustain the war over the long term. The Washington Post reported on October 27 that the Russian economy is ""in danger of overheating,"" noting that Russia's excessively high military spending has fueled economic growth in a way that has forced Russian companies to artificially raise their salaries in order to fulfill labor demands by remaining competitive with Russia‚Äôs high military salaries.[1] The Washington Post quoted Russian Central Bank Head Elvira Nabiullina, who warned in July 2024 that Russia's labor force and production capacity are ""almost exhausted."" 

The Washington Post noted that private Russian companies are struggling to keep up with Russian military salaries and are increasingly having to offer wages several times higher than the typical industry averages. ISW has recently reported that Russian regional authorities are significantly increasing the one-time signing bonuses for Russian contract servicemembers in order to sustain Russia‚Äôs rate of force generation (roughly 30,000 troops per month), which underscores the fact that Russia does not have an indefinite pool of manpower and must financially and socially reckon with the ever-growing costs of replenishing its frontline losses via various force-generation avenues.[2] 

The Washington Post also noted that Russia's stringent migration policies, particularly after the March 2024 Crocus City Hall attack, have further depleted Russia's labor pool and amplified economic frictions. This has particularly become the case as migrant workers are increasingly identifying Russia as a hostile and unattractive place to relocate for work.[3] ISW has reported at length on the balance that Putin is trying to strike between catering to his pro-war ultranationalist constituency, which espouses extreme anti-migrant sentiments, and his practical need to leverage migrant labor both economically and militarily.[4]

Putin very likely assesses that calling another partial mobilization wave, or introducing general mobilization, will be too costly to his regime, and has therefore resorted to crypto-mobilization efforts that appear to be placing greater and greater strains on the Russian wartime economy. The recent appearance of North Korean troops in Russia, and their reported deployment to the combat zone in Kursk Oblast, further suggests that Putin's entire force-generation system is very tenuous.[5] 

The costs of fueling the war will increase as Russia continues to burn through manpower and materiel on the frontline. Russian resources are finite, and Putin cannot reckon with these costs indefinitely. Russia's economy will reach a burnout point. That burnout point will inflict great costs on Russian society, which may force Putin to make major decisions about how to resource Russia‚Äôs war or change Russia‚Äôs mode of warfighting to preserve his regime‚Äôs stability. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-27-2024",1fkglfj

Putin has touted a new international payments framework to world leaders gathered in Russia this week, eager to show how he is shrugging off western sanctions and challenging the US-dominated global financial order.

The main problem with the proposal is that the US has made it clear to third countries that working with Russia‚Äôs war machine will cost them access to the dollar, hampering the Kremlin‚Äôs efforts to build a sanctions-proof payments network.

The effect has been particularly pronounced since December last year, when the US issued an executive order threatening secondary sanctions against entities involved in funding and supplying the Russian war effort.

The chilling effect spurred banks in countries such as Turkey and China to sharply cut back on dealings with Russian counterparties well beyond the executive order‚Äôs scope.

Russia uses non-western currencies for about 80 per cent of its cross-border trade, up from 20 per cent before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, said Agathe Demarais, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.

‚ÄúIn the long run, there is no doubt that mechanisms like Brics Bridge could be useful for China, Russia or others to hide sensitive transactions from western authorities ‚Äî for instance, relating to Chinese shipments of dual-use goods to Russia,‚Äù said Demarais.

Suspilne's sources noted that Ukrainian strikes are undermining Russia's ability to conduct long-range missile strikes against Ukraine.[8] Ukrainian forces conducted a series of HIMARS strikes against Russian ammunition depots throughout occupied Ukraine in Summer 2022, prompting Russian forces to disperse ammunition storage facilities and degrading the efficiency of Russian logistics at the time.[9] 

Repeated strikes against ammunition depots within Russia that cause similar levels of damage to the strike in Toropets may force a similar decision point on the Russian military command to reorganize and disperse support and logistics systems within Russia to mitigate the impact of such strikes.  Russian forces may not have addressed vulnerabilities at many logistics facilities within Russia due to the sanctuary space that restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western-provided weapons have generated, although the Toropets facility is not within range of Western systems fired from Ukraine. 

The lifting of restrictions on the use of Western systems and the continued development of Ukraine's own long-range strike capabilities may allow Ukrainian forces to more effectively exploit such Russian vulnerabilities. Ukrainian forces struck another Russian ammunition depot near Sergeevka, Voronezh Oblast in July 2024 and continued Ukrainian strikes against Russian ammunition and missile storage facilities could also destroy an important portion of Russia's materiel reserves.[10] 

Ukrainian strikes against facilities within Russia could impact offensive operations throughout the theater in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces have the materiel, capabilities, and permission to conduct such a strike campaign against logistics and support facilities within Russia at scale. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-18-2024",1fkglfj

lobi2c2,"Russian milblogger analyses of Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine continue to suggest that the Kremlin perceives Western commitment to Ukraine as feeble. Prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger Mikhail Zvinchuk gave an interview to Belarusian state newswire Belta on September 20 describing the war in Ukraine as a ‚Äústrange under-war"" that predominantly operates on a political plane.[41] 

Zvinchuk claimed that the West‚Äôs primary objective of the war in Ukraine is not to achieve a strategic military defeat of Russia, but rather to secure profits and political advantages domestically. He noted that if the West genuinely aimed to defeat Russia, it would have provided Ukraine with more weapons and means of combat along with greater NATO involvement. 

Zvinchuk argued that the West‚Äôs actions have not significantly challenged Russia and suggested that the West‚Äôs slow and limited support has given Russia enough time to strengthen its defenses and build up its forces. Zvinchuk also falsely claimed that Ukraine is simply a testing ground for Western artificial intelligence (AI) and command and control (C2) systems, echoing previous Russian statements suggesting that Ukraine is simply a military testing site for the West.[42] 

Western hesitation in approving Ukraine's ability to use long-range Western-provided weapons to strike military objects in Russia and previous delays in Western aid provision to Ukraine may have further confirmed the Kremlin's assessment that Russia can outlast Western support for Ukraine.[43] Western policymakers maintain the power to properly equip Ukraine and challenge the Kremlin's assessment of Western commitment to Ukraine. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-21-2024",1fkglfj

luoutr1," Russia will need to raise taxes further to fund its war in Ukraine, according to economists who say revenue-raising measures already announced will not be enough to fund the country's ballooning military spending.
Russia's draft 2025 budget allocates about one-third of total expenditure, or 6.3% of GDP, to the military - the highest level since the Cold War. For the first time, the share of spending on defence will be double that of social spending.

The huge increase in military spending is generating inflationary heat in Russia's economy. Interest rates have risen to their highest since 2003 and the rouble has slid to a one-year low against the dollar. With Western sanctions effectively barring Moscow from the international bond markets its fundraising options are limited.

The government has already started raising taxes to fund its war in Ukraine, now in its third year. A major tax reform is expected to generate additional revenues worth 1.7% of GDP in 2025.

They are likely to be a logistical burden for the Russians and there will be cultural, doctrinal and tactical tensions with the integration of the North Koreans into Russian forces. Given the size of the North Korean contingent, they are unlikely to have a decisive impact on the war in Ukraine. Russia is currently suffering around 1200 casualties a day in Ukraine. The North Koreans represent about a week‚Äôs human expenditure by Russia.

However, if these deployments are conducted more regularly, they could be a way for Russia to sustain the current offensive in the east of Ukraine AND sustain high numbers of casualties without having to undertake another mobilisation in 2025.

North Korea, which already supplies rockets and artillery munitions to the Russian war effort, has much to gain from becoming a co-belligerent in the war against Ukraine. Politically, it ensures it has a grateful ‚Äúfellow traveller‚Äù in Russia. Additionally, Russia may provide an array of financial incentives for North Korea‚Äôs troop deployment. It is likely to share with North Korea many of the new tactics and technologies developed for the war, as well as intelligence on captured Western equipment.

luhov3u,"The rate of Russian advances in Ukraine has increased in recent weeks but remains slow and consistent with positional warfare rather than with rapid mechanized maneuver‚Äîemphasizing how generally stagnant Russian advances have been after over two and half years of war. Recent Western reporting linking the Russian rate of advance in September 2024 with Russian advances at the start of the war is highly misleading.[1] 

ISW assesses that Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 1,265 square kilometers per day in March 2022‚Äîroughly 90 times the roughly 14 square kilometers that ISW calculates that Russian forces have taken per day in September 2024. Rapid Russian advances deep into Ukrainian territory, including the temporary seizure of large portions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv oblasts characterized the first month of the Russian full-scale invasion, whereas more recent Russian advances have been characterized by small-scale, localized, tactical advances.[2] 

Russian forces have been making gains in eastern Ukraine recently, but comparing those gains to the initial deep Russian penetration into Ukraine at the start of the war misleadingly frames these most recent advances. For example, Russian forces seized the settlement of Vuhledar as of October 1, 2024, have continued to advance north and northwest of Vuhledar, and have made significant tactical gains in and near Selydove (southeast of Pokrovsk) over the course of the past week.[3] 

These respective advances are tactically significant but do not represent a general increase in the pace of Russian advances across the frontline, much of which remains relatively stagnant, nor are they within two orders of magnitude of the rate of Russian advance in the first stage of the war.[4] 

The current rate of Russian advances is consistent, rather, with ISW's recent assessment that the Russian command has likely ordered Russian forces to significantly increase their tempo of mechanized attacks throughout the theater before the full onset of muddy ground conditions in the fall months. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-29-2024",1fkglfj

lsd226p,"I can understand his logic, but neither is an easy path to peace.    
    
Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal, and has been punished for it. Russia isn't going to allow overt nuclear re-armament of its neighbour. Ukraine would have to arrange it rapidly and in secret, and surprise Russia with the capability - unlikely to happen.   
  
Meanwhile, NATO won't accept a new member currently engaged in a war over its territory, because that would in effect demand NATO declare war on the belligerent (in this case, Russia). It can only accept Ukraine as an aspirant country and draw up the conditions of accession.      
      
Both options are only realistic after hostilities have frozen, and Russia is likely to make NATO membership and nuclear armament conditions of any ceasefire. It's a catch 22.    
    
These two options would have likely prevented the invasion, but that horse has bolted. I'm not sure what Ukraine's path to peace can be, as long as Russia remains committed to the war. A war of attrition favours Russia, so long as its economy, manpower and military remain significantly larger than Ukraine's.   
  
If allies removed the conditions limiting western arms being used on Russian territory, if a revolutionary technology is developed that gives Ukraine the upper hand, or if the Russian government - especially Putin - falls, that would improve Ukraine's chances of survival without conceding swathes of territory. It's a horrible position to be in, and we should never forget what Russia has done.",1fkglfj

Since the culture is not monolithic, some parts of it can be self-destructive. You can proudly claim to be a Ukrainian but so can a Donbas separatist. The claim doesn't inherently define what kind of Ukrainian you are, and what kind of culture you belong to. Being a part of self-destructive Ukrainian culture is bad and should be called out, but being a part of that culture doesn't necessarily mean you are also a part of Russian-speaker Ukrainian culture. Although there is certainly a correlation between the two because of multiple factors like being more susceptible to Russian propaganda or potentially having fewer consequences than Ukrainian speakers in the case of Russian occupation. You already claimed that this is simply about your survival, that's not exactly a moral high ground considering the possible consequences to other Ukrainians.

So basically they believe Ashkenazi Jews aren‚Äôt real Jews but evil imposters and because of this any racism directed at Ashkenazis isn‚Äôt actually antisemitism because they‚Äôre not actually Jews.

Ich meine, ich sehe durchaus Parallelen zwischen Putin und Hitler.

Hitler hat ja zudem noch nach der Machtergreifung die DNVP einverleibt, Leute wie Alfred Hugenberg wurden dabei eiskalt abserviert.

So einen Zug habe ich bei Putin zwar noch nicht gesehen. Aber ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass Putin √§hnlich handeln wird, wenn es tats√§chlich zu einem Eurasien nach seinen Vorstellung kommen sollte. Letzteres halte ich aber im Moment f√ºr sehr unwahrscheinlich.

Die AfD-Hansel glauben ja gerne, dass Putin ihr bester Freund ist. Und Putin ist ziemlich gut darin, diesen Eindruck zu erwecken. Aber die AfD ist f√ºr Putin nur ein Mittel zum Zweck, um Deutschland destabilisieren zu k√∂nnen. Putin braucht keinen, der seine Macht in irgendeiner Art und Weise herausfordert.

Aber gut, wenn dir das Gleichnis grunds√§tzlich nicht gef√§llt, dann ersetze meinetwegen Feuer durch Raub. Deiner Lesart nach sollte man den Raub und die Hilferufe des Nachbars ignorieren, weil der √úberfall nicht im eigenen Haus stattfindet.

Sicherlich kann man erw√§gen, inwiefern es der eigenen Sicherheit zutr√§glich ist, sich in so einem Fall einzumischen - aber dann sollte man schon ehrlich zugeben, dass es tats√§chlich um die eigene Sicherheit geht und nicht darum, dass es f√ºr den Nachbarn schon besser sein und der Einbruch viel pfleglicher ablaufen wird, wenn man sich nicht einmischt und wenn am besten auch der Nachbar mit den R√§ubern kooperiert.  
Allerdings ist es mit der eigenen Sicherheit auch irgendwann vorbei, wenn R√§uber - durch den Erfolg und die fehlende Unterst√ºtzung f√ºr das erste Opfer ermutigt - nach weiteren Zielen Ausschau halten.

kho66ig,"Bard's response to this inquiry: ""What does science say? What are the odds, in %, of humanity being here in the year 2100?""  
 

Predicting the future, especially on such a scale as humanity's survival in 80 years, is incredibly complex and fraught with uncertainties. Science doesn't provide a single, definitive answer to the odds of our existence in 2100. However, it can offer various perspectives and estimates based on different models and risk factors.

Here are some key points to consider:

**Expert Estimates:**

* **Global Catastrophic Risk Survey:** In 2019, a survey of hundreds of experts on existential risks estimated a median of **6% chance** of human extinction by 2100.
* **Superforecasters:** A community of experts specializing in predicting difficult questions estimated a **1% chance** of extinction and a **9% chance** of a major catastrophe impacting at least 10% of the population by 2100.

**Main Risk Factors:**

* **Nuclear war:** Although the probability is considered low, accidental or intentional nuclear detonation could have devastating consequences.
* **Climate change:** Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea level rise pose significant threats to food security, resource availability, and human migration.
* **Emerging diseases:** Pandemics like COVID-19 highlight the potential for rapidly spreading infectious diseases to disrupt societies and cause high mortality rates.
* **Technological advances:** Artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and other emerging technologies offer incredible potential but also carry risks of misuse or unintended consequences.

**Important Disclaimers:**

* These are just estimates, and the actual probabilities could be higher or lower.
* Many scenarios and events can drastically alter the course of the future, making predictions inherently uncertain.
* Focus solely on probability can be misleading; understanding the nature and severity of potential risks is equally important.

**Conclusion:**

Science doesn't give a fixed percentage chance of humanity's survival in 2100. Instead, it highlights various possible futures and the significant risks we face. While the odds might seem daunting, focusing on proactive risk mitigation, global cooperation, and responsible development of solutions offers the best chance for a thriving future for generations to come.

Remember, the future is not predetermined. By understanding the challenges and actively working towards solutions, we can increase the likelihood of a positive outcome for humanity.",195p8ey
